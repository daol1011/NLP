    "\n",
    "When Python is installed, it is installed globally, meaning that all users and applications use the same version and, more importantly, the same version of packages (libraries). As we might have some applications that run only with a specific version of a library, it is hard and sometimes impossible to resolve version conflicts system-wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore it is possible to create *environments*, of which you can think of as encapsulated copies of the python interpreter and a set of specific versions of packages (the idea of containerization before and during the earliest years of docker). It is customary to specify the versions in a file called `requirements.txt`, which lists the package name `wordcloud`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We strongly recommend creating environments to avoid global version conflicts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, nothing prevents you in principle to just install the required packages in the global namespace. We will use the latest version of packages (as listed on https://pypi.org/) and are unlikely to encounter version conflicts. We will not deduce points for using a global installation per se, but note that when version conflicts occur, this falls within your responsibility. When your submission is not executable due to this, this is obviously not helpful."

WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. >> 2002 -- >> THAT IS A MAINSTREAM MEDIA NONSENSE PUT OUT BY MY QUESTION WAS -- >> YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT I SAID. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES. AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENTS THIS. THAT IF HIS TAX PLAN, WHICH WOULD BLOW UP THE DEBT BY OVER $5 TRILLION AND WOULD, IN SOME INSTANCES, DISADVANTAGE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES COMPARED TO THE WEALTHY, WERE TO GO INTO EFFECT, WE WOULD LOSE 3.5 MILLION JOBS. AND MAYBE HAVE ANOTHER RECESSION. THEY'VE LOOKED AT MY PLANS AND THEY'VE SAID, OKAY, IF WE CAN DO THIS, AND I INTEND TO GET IT DONE, WE WILL HAVE 10 MILLION MORE NEW JOBS BECAUSE OF STATE. >> EXCUSE ME, YOUR HUSBAND SIGNED NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. >> THAT IS YOUR OPINION. >> YOU GO TO NEW ENGLAND, GO TO OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, YOU GO TO ANYWHERE YOU WANT, SECRETARY CLINTON, AND YOU WILL SEE DEVASTATION WHERE MANUFACTURERS DOWN NA N NAFTA IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL SIGNED ANYWHERE, IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW YOU WANT TO APPROVE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF IT THEN HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING HOW BAD IT IS AND SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE. THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I ALSO HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE HAS. YOU KNOW? I HAVE A MUCH BETTER -- SHE SPENT, LET ME TELL YOU, SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ADVERTISING -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET, MAYBE BY FAR, IS MY TEMPERAMENT. I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT. I KNOW HOW TO WIN. SHE DOES NOT -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON? >> WAIT. THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY THE CHINESE. I THINK IT'S REAL. >> I DID NOT. >> SCIENCE IS REAL. >> I DID NOT SAY THAT. TROUBLING OF THESE HAS BEEN RUSSIA. THERE'S NO DOUBT NOW THAT RUSSIA HAS USED I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS FRONT OF A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE, HE CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT STAMINA. >> THE WORLD -- LET ME TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS DURING THE BALANCE FAMILY AND WORK. I'VE HEARD FROM SO MANY OF YOU ABOUT THE DIFFICULT CHOICES YOU FACE AND THE STRESSES THAT YOU'RE UNDER. SO LET'S HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. EARNED SICK DAYS. LET'S BE SURE WE HAVE AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE AND DEBT-FREE COLLEGE. HAPPEN. UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, >> MR. TRUMP -- >> TYPICAL POLITICIAN. ALL TALK, NO ACTION. SOUNDS GOOD, DOESN'T WORK. NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. OUR COUNTRY IS SUFFERING BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE SECRETARY CLINTON HAVE MADE SUCH THEY COST TWO, THREE, FOUR TIMES WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COST. WE BUY PRODUCTS FOR OUR MILITARY AND COME AT COSTS THAT ARE SO FAR ABOVE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET, THE BUDGET IS BAD TO A LARGE EXTENT BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO IDEA AS TO WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO BUY. THE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL IS WAY UNDERBUDGET AND WAY PEOPLE IN CHICAGO HAVE BEEN KILLED. WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER. NOW, WHETHER OR NOT IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO YOU DO STOP AND FRISK, WHICH WORKED VERY WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING AND LIFTING UP, BUT WE DO ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. THERE ARE THE RIGHT WAYS OF DOING IT AND THEN THERE ARE WAYS THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE YEARS, YOU PERPETUATED A FALSE CLAIM OF THE NATION'S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT WAS NOT A NATURAL BORN CITIZEN. YOU QUESTIONED HIS LEGITIMACY. THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT MOST AMERICANS HAVE ACCEPTED FOR YOU RESPOND TO THAT. THERE'S A LOT THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL HEALING IN THIS SEGMENT. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICANS -- DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY -- >> WRONG. >> -- PROVED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. >> WRONG. >> HE ACTUALLY ADVOCATED FOR THE KNOW, ARE MUSLIM MAJORITY NATIONS. DONALD HAS CONSISTENTLY INSULTED MUSLIMS ABROAD. MUSLIMS AT HOME. WHEN WE NEED TO BE COOPERATING WITH MUSLIM NATIONS AND WITH THE AMERICAN MUSLIM COMMUNITY. THEY'RE ON THE FRONT LINES. THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US THAT WE MIGHT NOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE. THEY NEED TO HAVE CLOSE WORKING COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THESE COMMUNITIES. NOT BE ALIENATED AND PUSHED AWAY AS SOME OF LOT OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION. WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. QUESTION -- >> WELL, ONE THING -- >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER TODAY IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S SECOND BIRTHDAY SO I THINK ABOUT THIS A LOT. FIRST, WE HAVE TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. TODAY IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S SECOND BIRTHDAY SO I THINK ABOUT THIS A LOT. FIRST, WE HAVE TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. THAT MEANS WE NEED NEW MINUTES. >> THANK YOU, LESTER. OUR JOBS ARE FLEEING THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO, THEY'RE GOING TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU LOOK AT WHAT CHINA IS DOING TO OUR COUNTRY IN TERMS OF SMART, FAIR TRADE DEALS. WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, DEALS. WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, OF BUSINESSES ON THE BACKS OF LITTLE GUYS, AND INDEED, I HAVE MET TODAY IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S SECOND BIRTHDAY SO I THINK ABOUT THIS A LOT. FIRST, WE HAVE TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. THAT MEANS WE NEED NEW JOBS, GOOD JOBS, WITH YOU HAVE UP TO TWO MINUTES. >> THANK YOU, LESTER. OUR JOBS ARE FLEEING THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO, THEY'RE GOING TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU LOOK AT WHAT CHINA DEALS. WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, OF BUSINESSES ON THE BACKS OF LITTLE GUYS, AND INDEED, I HAVE MET A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE STIFFED BY YOU AND YOUR BUSINESSES, DONALD. I'VE MET DISHWASHERS, PAINTERS, ARCHITECTS, GLASS INSTALLERS, MARBLE INSTALLERS, DRAPERY INSTALLERS LIKE MY DAD WAS, WHO YOU REFUSED TO PAY CHANGE THE LAWS, YOU'VE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME, CHANGE THE LAW. BUT I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS OF THE NATION BECAUSE I'M RUNNING A COMPANY, MY HAVE THE GREATEST MESS ANYONE'S EVER SEEN. YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST. IT'S A TOTAL MESS. UNDER YOUR DIRECTION TO A LARGE EXTENT, BUT YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU STARTED THE IRAN DEAL. THAT'S ANOTHER BEAUTY WHERE YOU HAVE A COUNTRY THAT WAS READY TO FALL, I MEAN, IT WAS DOING SO BADLY, THEY WERE CHOKING ON TODAY IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S SECOND BIRTHDAY SO I THINK ABOUT THIS A LOT. FIRST, WE HAVE TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. YOU HAVE UP TO TWO MINUTES. >> THANK YOU, LESTER. OUR JOBS ARE FLEEING THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO, THEY'RE GOING TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU LOOK AT WHAT CHINA DEALS. WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE FIRST OF ALL, THEY DID GET PAID A LOT, BUT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS OF THE NATION. NOW, IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE LAWS, YOU'VE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME, CHANGE THE LAW. BUT I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS OF THE NATION BECAUSE I'M IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM. I HAVE A SON, HE'S 10 YEARS OLD. BIRTHDAY SO I THINK ABOUT THIS A LOT. FIRST, WE HAVE TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. THAT MEANS WE NEED NEW YOU HAVE UP TO TWO MINUTES. >> THANK YOU, LESTER. OUR JOBS ARE FLEEING THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO, THEY'RE GOING TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU LOOK AT WHAT CHINA DEALS. WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THE END OF THIS EVENING I'M GOING TO BE BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED. >> WHY NOT. >> WHY NOT, YEAH. THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T PAY ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. >> THAT MAKES ME SMART. >> IF HE'S PAID ZERO, THAT MEANS ZERO FOR TROOPS, ZERO FOR VETS, ZERO FOR SCHOOLS OR HEALTH, AND I THINK PROBABLY HE'S NOT ALL THAT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HAVING THE REST OF OUR COUNTRY SEE WHAT THE REAL REASONS ARE BECAUSE IT MUST BE SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT, EVEN TERRIBLE THAT HE'S TRYING TO HIDE. AND THE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, THEY DON'T GIVE YOU THE TAX RATE. THEY DON'T GIVE YOU ALL THE DETAILS THAT TAX RETURNS WOULD. AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO SEE AND I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S EVER GOING TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING HE'S HIDING. ANDGUESSING AT WHAT IT MIGHT BE THAT HE'S HIDING BUT I THINK THE QUESTION IS WERE HE EVER TO GET NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT WOULD BE THOSE CONFLICTS? WHO DOES HE OWE MONEY TO? WELL, HE OWES YOU THE ANSWERS TO THAT. AND HE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM. >> HE ALSO -- HE ALSO RAISED THE ISSUE OF YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY BACKS OF LITTLE GUYS, AND INDEED, I HAVE MET LIKE MY DAD WAS, WHO YOU REFUSED TO PAY CHANGE THE LAWS, YOU'VE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME, CHANGE THE LAW. BUT I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS OF THE NATION BECAUSE I'M RUNNING A COMPANY, MY UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PAINTS SUCH A DIRE RESPOND. >> PLEASE RESPOND THEN I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. >> LOOK, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LET DOWN BY OUR POLITICIANS. THEY TALK GOOD AROUND WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON CREATED A VACUUM THE WAY THEY GOT OUT OF AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. ACTUALLY DOING SOME BUSINESS WITH HIM ONE TIME. BUT THE LARGER POINT, HE SAYS THIS CONSTANTLY, IS GEORGE W. BUSH MADE THE BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. BIRTHDAY SO I THINK ABOUT THIS A LOT. FIRST, WE HAVE TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE FROM SMALL BUSINESS. WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE THE ECONOMY FAIRER. THAT STARTS WITH RAISING THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE AND ALSO TO DO, BUT PERHAPS WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT LATER. BUT WE HAVE TO STOP OUR JOBS FROM BEING STOLEN FROM US. UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG PERSPECTIVES. I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW, DONALD WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN HIS LIFE AND THAT'S ALL TO HIS BENEFIT. HE STARTED HIS BUSINESS WITH $14 MILLION, BORROWED FROM HIS FATHER, AND HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT THE MORE YOU HELP PAINT IN AND TOOK THE SQUEEGEE AND KEPT GOING. WHAT I BELIEVE, THE MORE WE CAN DO FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE MORE WE CAN INVEST IN YOU, YOUR EDUCATION, YOUR PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY WE CAN DO. WE CAN DEPLOY A HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS. WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME. WE CAN BUILD A NEW MODERN ELECTRIC GRID. THAT'S A LOT OF JOBS. BACK TO WHAT GOT US IN TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. >> MR. TRUMP? >> SHE TALKS ABOUT SOLAR PANELS. WE INVESTED IN A SOLAR COMPANY, COUNTRY, THAT WAS A DISASTER. THEY LOST PLENTY OF MONEY ON THAT ONE. NOW, LOOK, I'M A GREAT BELIEVER IN ALL FORMS THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE AND STREAMLINE THEM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. WHAT I HAVE PROPOSED WOULD BE PAID FOR BY RAISING TAXES ON THE TRILLION. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> AND LOOK AT HER WEBSITE. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL BUT TOP. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> TYPICAL POLITICIAN. BELIEVE ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET, BUT IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES EVEN A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S GOING TO COME CRASHING DOWN. WE ARE IN A BIG, FAT, UGLY BUBBLE, AND WE BETTER BE AWFULLY POLITICAL THAN SECRETARY CLINTON. >> MR. TRUMP, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER TAKING THE 5th, I >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER TAKING THE 5th, I AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PAINTS SUCH A DIRE NEGATIVE PICTURE OF BLACK COMMUNITIES IN OUR COUNTRY. THE VIBRANCY OF THE BLACK CHURCH, THE BLACK BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY SO MANY PEOPLE. THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT SO MANY FAMILIES ARE WORKING TO PROVIDE FOR PASS A PROHIBITION ON ANYONE WHO'S ON THE TERRORIST WATCHLIST POLICE ARE IMPLICITLY BIASED AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE? >> LESTER, I THINK IMPLICIT BIAS IS A PROBLEM FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST POLICE. I THINK, UNFORTUNATELY, TOO RESPOND. >> PLEASE. >> FIRST OF ALL, I AGREE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE EVEN WITHIN MY OWN PARTY WANT TO GIVE THEM GET OFF, BUT I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT. QUITE STRONGLY. I DO WANT TO BRING UP THE FACT THAT YOU WERE THE ONE THAT BROUGHT DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU DECIDED TO STAY HOME AND THAT'S OKAY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER AND I'VE MET SOME OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE I'LL EVER MEET WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY UPSET WITH WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE TOLD THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. NATURAL BORN CITIZEN. YOU QUESTIONED HIS LEGITIMACY. THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT MOST AMERICANS CREATING JOBS. I WANT TO GET ON TO HAVING A STRONG BORDER. BECAUSE I WANT TO GET ON TO THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COUNTRY. >> I'LL LET YOU RESPOND. THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG RECORD OF ENGAGING IN RACIST BEHAVIOR. YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID IT WAS TRUE. SO WHEN YOU TRY TO ACT WE WILL TAKE OUT ISIS. WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA THEM OUT. SHE'S BEEN DOING IT A LONG TIME. SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO TAKE THEM OUT FOR A LONG TIME. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN FORMED IF THEY LEFT SOME TROOPS CONSTANTLY, IS GEORGE W. BUSH MADE THE AGREEMENT ABOUT WHEN UNDER YOUR DIRECTION TO A LARGE EXTENT, BUT YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU STARTED THE IRAN DEAL. THAT'S ANOTHER BEAUTY WHERE YOU HAVE A COUNTRY THAT WAS READY TO FALL, I MEAN, IT WAS DOING SO BADLY, THEY WERE CHOKING ON JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE THEIR HANDS ON ANY NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SO A MAN WHO CAN BE PROVOKED BY A TWEET SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS FINGERS ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUCLEAR CODES AS FAR AS I THINK ANYONE WITH ANY SENSE ABOUT THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNED. >> GETTING A LITTLE A LOT OF THING, JUST TO RESPOND. I AGREE WITH HER ON ONE THING. THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM THE WORLD HAS IS NUCLEAR ARMAMENT, IF SHE EVER WINS THIS RACE, THEY WON'T BE TAKEN CARE OF. >> MR. TRUMP, THIS YEAR SECRETARY CLINTON BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT BY A MAJOR PARTY. EARLIER THIS MONTH YOU RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. YOU. I WANT US TO INVEST IN YOUR FUTURE. THAT MEANS JOBS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADVANCED MANUFACTURING. INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY. CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY AND SMALL BUSINESS BECAUSE MOST OF THE NEW JOBS WILL COME FROM SMALL BUSINESS. WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG BUSINESSES. THAT'S GOING TO BE A JOB CREATOR LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE RONALD REAGAN. IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH. ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY SOME AND MAKE SOME MONEY. WELL, IT DID COLLAPSE. >> THAT'S CALLED BUSINESS, BY THE WAY. >> 9 MILLION PEOPLE, 9 MILLION PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS. ECONOMY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND BELIEVE ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET, BUT IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES EVEN A LITTLE FROM SMALL BUSINESS. WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE THE ECONOMY FAIRER. THAT STARTS WITH RONALD REAGAN. IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH. COMPANIES WILL COME. THEY WILL BUILD. THEY WILL EXPAND. NEW COMPANIES WILL START. AND I LOOK VERY, VERY MUCH FORWARD TO DOING IT. WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. >> OH, YEAH. >> -- THAT IS NOT THE FACTS. I DID SAY, I HOPED IT WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL. WHEN IT WAS NEGOTIATED -- SHOWS, READING THE PAPERS, ALMOST EVERY LAWYER SAYS YOU DON'T RELEASE YOUR RETURNS UNTIL THE AUDIT'S RETURNS, BUT EVERYONE HAS DONE IT. WE KNOW THE IRS HAS MADE CLEAR THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK PRESIDENT. OVER -- ALMOST 4,000 PEOPLE IN CHICAGO HAVE BEEN KILLED. WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER. NOW, WHETHER OR NOT IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO YOU DO STOP AND FRISK, WHICH WORKED VERY WELL, MAYOR GIULIANI IS HERE, IT WORKED VERY WELL IN NEW YORK. THEN THERE ARE WAYS THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND SYDNEY BLUMENTHAL WORKS FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF SECRETARY CLINTON. AND HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, PATTI DOYLE, WENT TO -- DURING THE CAMPAIGN, HER CAMPAIGN AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA, FOUGHT VERY HARD, AND YOU CAN GO LOOK IT UP AND YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT AND IF YOU LOOK AT CNN THIS PAST WEEK, PATTI DOYLE WAS ON \"WOLF BLITZER\" SAYING THAT THIS HAPPENED. BLUMENTHAL SENT McCLATCHY, HIGHLY RESPECTED REPORTER, TO KENYA TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT. >> WELL, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HEARD. AND CLEARLY AS DONALD JUST ADMITTED, HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO STAND ON THIS DEBATE STAGE AND LESTER HOLT WAS GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE RACIST BIRTHER LIE TO BED. IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I ALSO HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE HAS. YOU KNOW? I HAVE A MUCH BETTER -- SHE SPENT, LET ME TELL YOU, SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ADVERTISING -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET, MAYBE BY FAR, IS MY TEMPERAMENT. I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT. I KNOW HOW TO WIN. SHE DOES NOT -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON? >> WAIT. THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT. >> WHO HAVE SAID WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO AND HAS BECOME A U.S. CITIZEN AND YOU CAN BET SHE'S GOING TO VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. >> OKAY. GOOD. LET ME JUST TELL YOU -- >> MR. TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT NICE. BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE ADS ON ME. MANY OF WHICH ARE GUARANTEE FINALLY EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK. I ALSO WANT TO SEE MORE COMPANIES DO PROFIT SHARING. IF YOU HELP CREATE THE PROFITS, YOU SHOULD BE UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAN WE'VE EVER HAD. BUT THE POLITICIANS HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT LEAVING. THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? MANUFACTURERS DOWN NA WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. THAT WOULD ADD $5 TRILLION TO THE DEBT. >> BUT YOU HAVE NO PLAN. >> EDUCATE -- OH, I DO. >> SECRETARY, YOU HAVE NO PLAN. >> I'VE WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT IT. IT'S CALLED \"STRONGER TOGETHER.\" WEBSITE. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS EVENING I'M GOING TO BE BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED. >> WHY NOT. >> WHY NOT, YEAH. WHY NOT. YOU KNOW, JUST JOIN THE DEBATE BY SAYING MORE CRAZY THINGS. NOW -- >> HEY, THERE'S NOTHING CRAZY ABOUT NOT LETTING OUR WORK. NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. OUR COUNTRY IS SUFFERING BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE SECRETARY CLINTON HAVE MADE SUCH BAD DECISIONS IN TERMS OF OUR JOBS, AND IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON. NOW, LOOK, WE HAVE THE WORST REVIVAL OF AN ECONOMY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND BELIEVE ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T HEALTH, AND I THINK PROBABLY HE'S NOT ALL THAT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HAVING THE REST OF OUR COUNTRY SEE WHAT THE REAL REASONS ARE BECAUSE IT MUST BE THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU OF BANKS, VERY FINE INSTITUTIONS, VERY FINE BANKS. I COULD DO THAT VERY QUICKLY. I'M VERY UNDERLEVERAGED. I HAVE A GREAT COMPANY. I HAVE A TREMENDOUS INCOME. THE REASON I SAY THAT IS NOT IN A QUICKLY. I'M VERY UNDERLEVERAGED. I HAVE A GREAT COMPANY. I HAVE A TREMENDOUS INCOME. THE REASON I SAY THAT IS NOT IN A >> UNBROKEN. AND I WILL TELL YOU, YOU LOOK AT THE INNER CITIES AND I JUST LEFT DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND TOLD THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. ADDRESSING. I HAVE PUT FORTH A PLAN TO DEFEAT ISIS. MAJORITY NATIONS. DONALD HAS CONSISTENTLY INSULTED MUSLIMS ABROAD. MUSLIMS AT HOME. WHEN WE NEED TO BE COOPERATING WITH MUSLIM NATIONS AND WITH THE AMERICAN MUSLIM COMMUNITY. THEY'RE ON THE FRONT LINES. THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US THAT WE MIGHT NOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE. THEY NEED TO HAVE CLOSE WORKING VERY STRONGLY, ABOUT WORKING WITH -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM FOR MANY YEARS AND WE HAVE THE GREATEST MESS AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST THEIR HANDS ON ANY NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SO A MAN WHO CAN BE SAYING WORDS MATTER. WORDS MATTER WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND THEY REALLY MATTER WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT. AND I WANT TO REASSURE OUR ALLIES IN JAPAN, >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE >> THE WORLD -- LET ME TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO WORK. I'VE HEARD FROM SO MANY OF YOU ABOUT THE DIFFICULT CHOICES YOU FACE AND THE STRESSES THAT YOU'RE UNDER. SO LET'S HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. EARNED SICK DAYS. LET'S BE SURE WE HAVE HAPPEN. UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG BUSINESSES. THAT'S GOING TO BE A PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, >> MR. TRUMP -- >> TYPICAL POLITICIAN. ALL TALK, NO ACTION. SOUNDS GOOD, DOESN'T WORK. NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. OUR COUNTRY IS SUFFERING BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE SECRETARY CLINTON HAVE MADE SUCH THEY COST TWO, THREE, FOUR TIMES WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COST. WE BUY PRODUCTS FOR OUR MILITARY AND COME AT COSTS THAT ARE SO FAR ABOVE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET, THE BUDGET IS BAD TO A LARGE EXTENT BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO IDEA AS TO WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO BUY. THE TRUMP PEOPLE IN CHICAGO HAVE BEEN KILLED. WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER. NOW, WHETHER OR NOT IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO YOU DO STOP AND FRISK, WHICH WORKED VERY WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING AND LIFTING UP, BUT WE DO ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. THERE ARE THE RIGHT WAYS OF DOING IT AND THEN THERE ARE WAYS THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE YEARS, YOU PERPETUATED A FALSE CLAIM OF THE NATION'S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT WAS NOT A NATURAL BORN CITIZEN. YOU QUESTIONED HIS LEGITIMACY. THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT MOST AMERICANS HAVE ACCEPTED FOR YOU RESPOND TO THAT. THERE'S A LOT THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL HEALING IN THIS SEGMENT. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICANS -- >> WELL, I WAS VERY -- DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY -- >> WRONG. >> -- PROVED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. >> WRONG. >> HE ACTUALLY ADVOCATED FOR THE WHEN WE NEED TO BE COOPERATING WITH MUSLIM NATIONS AND WITH THE AMERICAN MUSLIM COMMUNITY. THEY'RE ON THE FRONT LINES. THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US THAT WE MIGHT NOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE. THEY NEED TO HAVE CLOSE WORKING COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THESE COMMUNITIES. NOT BE ALIENATED AND PUSHED AWAY AS SOME OF LOT OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION. WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. QUESTION -- >> WELL, ONE THING -- >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FACE AND THE STRESSES THAT YOU'RE UNDER. SO LET'S HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. EARNED SICK DAYS. BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD AND HERE'S WHAT WE CAN DO. WE CAN DEPLOY A HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS. WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER LEAVING. THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE >> YOU ARE GOING TO APPROVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN HISTORY. YOU'RE GOING TO APPROVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN HISTORY. YOU'RE GOING TO APPROVE WHONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX INCREASES IN HISTORY. YOU ARE GOING TO DRIVE BUSINESS OUT. YOUR REGULATIONS ARE A DISASTER. YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE REGULATIONS ALL OVER THE PLACE. BY THE WAY, MY TAX CUT IS THE BIGGEST SINCE RONALD REAGAN. I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. IT WILL CREATE TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF >> I'D LIKE TO RESPOND. >> PLEASE RESPOND THEN I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. >> LOOK, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LET DOWN BY OUR POLITICIANS. THEY TALK GOOD AROUND ELECTION TIME LIKE RESPOND. >> PLEASE RESPOND THEN I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. >> LOOK, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LET DOWN BY OUR POLITICIANS. THEY TALK GOOD AROUND >> PLEASE RESPOND THEN I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. >> LOOK, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LET DOWN BY OUR POLITICIANS. THEY TALK GOOD AROUND ELECTION TIME LIKE RIGHT NOW, AND AFTER THE ELECTION, THEY SAY, SEE YOU LATER, I'LL SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY -- LOOK, THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE INNER CITIES HAS BEEN SO BADLY TREATED. THEY'VE BEEN ABUSED AND USED IN ORDER TO GET VOTES BY DEMOCRAT AND SECRETARY CLINTON CREATED A VACUUM THE WAY THEY GOT OUT OF IRAQ BECAUSE THEY GOT OUT WRONG. WHERE YOU HAVE A COUNTRY THAT WAS READY TO FALL, I MEAN, IT WAS DOING SO BADLY, THEY WERE CHOKING ON BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER BY HAVING THE WEALTHY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE AND CLOSE THE CORPORATE LOOPHOLES. FINALLY WE TONIGHT ARE ON THE STAGE TOGETHER, DONALD TRUMP AND I. DONALD, IT'S GOOD TO GOOD. I WANT YOU TO BE VERY HAPPY. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. BUT IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, WHEN SHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS, IT WAS REALLY VERY RECENTLY. SHE'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. AND WHY HASN'T SHE MADE THE AGREEMENTS BETTER? THE NAFTA AGREEMENT IS DEFECTIVE. JUST BECAUSE OF THE TAX AND MANY OTHER REASONS, BUT JUST BECAUSE OF THE -- >> LET ME INTERRUPT JUST A MOMENT. CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY THE CHINESE. I THINK IT'S REAL. CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY THE CHINESE. I THINK IT'S REAL. THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- EXCUSE ANY. I WILL BRING BACK JOBS. YOU CAN'T BRING BACK JOBS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY, I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS QUITE A BIT. >> YEAH, FOR 30 YEARS. >> I HAVE -- WELL, NOT QUITE THAT LONG. I THINK MY HUSBAND DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN THE 1990s. I THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WORKED AND HOW -- ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. >> -- THAT IS NOT THE FACTS. I DID SAY, I HOPED IT WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL. WHEN IT WAS NEGOTIATED -- >> NOT. >> -- WHICH I WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR, I CONCLUDED IT WASN'T. MINE WOULD CREATE 10 MILLION JOBS AND YOURS WOULD LOSE US 3.5 MILLION JOBS AND EXPLODE THE DEBT -- >> YOU ARE GOING TO TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING >> WHY NOT, YEAH. WHY NOT. YOU KNOW, JUST JOIN THE DEBATE BY SAYING MORE CRAZY THINGS. NOW -- >> HEY, THERE'S NOTHING CRAZY ABOUT NOT LETTING OUR COMPANIES BRING THEIR NATION BECAUSE I'M RUNNING A COMPANY, MY OBLIGATION RIGHT NOW IS TO DO WELL FOR MYSELF, MY FAMILY, MY EMPLOYEES, FOR MY COMPANIES AND THAT'S WHAT I DO. BUT WHAT SHE DOESN'T SAY IS THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLY HAPPY AND THEY LOVE ME. I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. WE'RE JUST OPENING UP ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE >> YOUR TWO MINUTES HAS EXPIRED. I DO WANT TO FOLLOW-UP. STOP AND FRISK WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN NEW YORK BECAUSE IT LARGELY SINGLED OUT BLACK AND HISPANIC YOUNG MEN. >> NO, YOU'RE WRONG. IT WENT BEFORE A JUDGE WHO WAS A VERY AGAINST POLICE JUDGE. IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HER AND OUR MAYOR, OUR NEW MAYOR, REFUSED TO GO FORWARD WITH THE CASE. THEY WOULD HAVE WANTED IT REPEALED. IF YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE MANY PLACES -- >> THE ARGUMENT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PAINTS SUCH A DIRE NEGATIVE PICTURE OF BLACK COMMUNITIES IN OUR COUNTRY. THE VIBRANCY OF THE BLACK CHURCH, THE BLACK BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY SO MANY PEOPLE. THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT SO MANY FAMILIES ARE WORKING TO PROVIDE FOR ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT GOT HIM TO PRODUCE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND I THINK I DID A GOOD JOB. YOU RESPOND TO THAT. THERE'S A LOT THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL HEALING IN THIS SEGMENT. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICANS -- >> WELL, I WAS VERY -- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA. COULD ALSO BE LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. ALSO COULD BE SOMEBODY SITTING ON THEIR BED THAT WEIGHS 400 POUNDS. OKAY? YOU DON'T KNOW WHO BROKE INTO DNC, BUT WHAT DID WE LEARN WITH DNC? WE LEARNED THAT BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY YOUR PEOPLE. BY DEBBIE WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. BUT BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. NOW, WHETHER THAT WAS RUSSIA, WHETHER THAT WAS CHINA, WHETHER IT DISASTERS. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I HOPE THE FACT CHECKERS ARE TURNING UP THE VOLUME AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. DONE. >> MY REFERENCE WAS WHAT YOU HAD SAID IN MY QUESTION WAS -- >> YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT I SAID. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY. YOU HAVE TO JUDGE US. THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE REALLY WORK TO GET NEW JOBS AND TO GET EXPORTS THAT HELP TO CREATE MORE NEW JOBS. >> VERY QUICKLY -- >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN 30 YEARS OR 26 YEARS. >> I'VE BEEN A SENATOR, DONALD. >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. >> I'VE BEEN A SENATOR, DONALD. >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. >> I'VE BEEN SECRETARY YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF IT THEN HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING HOW BAD IT IS AND SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE. YUAN IF Y YOU KNOW IF YOU DID WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING AND ANY BUSINESS CONFLICTS. DON'T AMERICANS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST? ARE POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING OUR TRADE DEALS. >> THE IRS SAYS AN AUDIT OF YOUR TAXES -- YOU'RE PERFECTLY FREE TO RELEASE YOUR TAXES DURING AN AUDIT. SO THE QUESTION, DOES THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW OUTWEIGH YOUR PERSONAL -- >> WELL, I TOLD YOU, I THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO SEE AND I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S EVER >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER TAKING THE 5th, I IMPORTANT -- >> IT WOULD BE SQUANDERED, TOO, BELIEVE ME. >> -- IS IF YOUR MAIN CLAIM TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR BUSINESS, THEN I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW, YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID THAT YOU BUILT A LOT OF BUSINESSES ON THE BACKS OF LITTLE GUYS, AND INDEED, I HAVE MET WORK THAT YOU ASKED THEM TO DO. WE HAVE AN ARCHITECT IN THE AUDIENCE WHO DESIGNED ONE OF YOUR CLUBHOUSES AT ONE OF YOUR GOLF COURSES. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FACILITY. IT IMMEDIATELY WAS PUT TO USE. AND YOU WOULDN'T PAY WHAT THE MAN NEEDED TO BE PAID WHAT HE WAS CHARGING YOU -- >> MAYBE HE DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB AND I WAS UNSATISFIED WITH HIS WORK WHICH OUR COUNTRY SHOULD DO, TOO. >> THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE STIFFED OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR THAT ARE THERE AND WHEN SECRETARY CLINTON TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T GET PAID, FIRST OF ALL, THEY DID GET PAID A LOT, BUT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS OF THE NATION. NOW, IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE LAWS, YOU'VE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME, CHANGE THE LAW. BUT I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS OF THE NATION BECAUSE I'M RUNNING A COMPANY, MY >> SECRETARY CLINTON, LAST WEEK YOU SAID WE'VE GOT DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE POLICING TO GO RIGHT AT IMPLICIT BIAS. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT POLICE ARE IMPLICITLY BIASED AGAINST BLACK TERMINATED BY CURRENT MAYOR. BUT STOP AND FRISK HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE SAFETY OF NEW YORK CITY, TREMENDOUS BEYOND BELIEF. SO WHEN YOU SAY IT HAS NO IMPACT, IT REALLY DID. IT HAD A VERY, VERY BIG IMPACT. >> WELL, IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY, IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS, THAT UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR, CRIME HAS CONTINUED TO DROP FAST. WHEN ISIS FORMED IN THIS VACUUM CREATED BY BARACK OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON, AND BELIEVE ME, YOU WERE THE ONES THAT TOOK OUT THE TROOPS. NOT ONLY THAT, YOU NAMED THE DAY. THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THEY SAT BACK PROBABLY AND SAID -- >> LESTER, WE COVERED THIS -- >> WAIT A MINUTE. THEY SAID WAIT A MINUTE, WHEN THEY FORMED, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. NOW YOU'RE TALKING I DON'T THINK SO. >> MR. TRUMP, WITH A LOT OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION. WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. >> 2002 -- >> THAT IS A MAINSTREAM MEDIA NONSENSE PUT OUT BY HER BECAUSE SHE FRANKLY I THINK THE BEST PERSON IN HER CAMPAIGN IS MAINSTREAM MEDIA. >> MY QUESTION -- >> WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR? I WAS AGAINST -- WAIT A MINUTE. I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. JUST SO YOU PUT IT OUT. >> THE RECORD SHOWS OTHERWISE. WHY -- >> THE RECORD DOES NOT SHOW -- >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY -- >> THE RECORD SHOWS THAT I'M RIGHT. WHEN I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD STERN, VERY LIKELY YOU HAVE TO JUDGE US. WHO CAN SHOULDER THE IMMENSE, AWESOME UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG BUSINESSES. THAT'S GOING TO BE A JOB CREATOR LIKE WE NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE PERSPECTIVES. I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW, DONALD WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN HIS LIFE AND THAT'S ALL TO HIS BENEFIT. HE STARTED HIS BUSINESS WITH $14 MILLION, BORROWED FROM HIS FATHER, AND HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU RAISED THE ISSUE OF YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A BRAGEDOSIOUS WAY. IT'S ABOUT TIME THIS COUNTRY HAS SOMEBODY RUNNING IT THAT HAS AN IDEA ABOUT MONEY. WHEN WE HAVE $20 TRILLION IN DEBT AND OUR COUNTRY'S A MESS, YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE $20 TRILLION IN DEBT AND OUR ROIDS ARE GOOD AND OUR BRIDGES ARE GOOD HAVE CAUSED THIS PROBLEM. OUR COUNTRY HAS TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS. WE'RE A DEBTOR NATION. WE'RE A SERIOUS DEBTOR NATION. AND WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT NEEDS NEW ROADS, NEW TUNNELS, NEW BRIDGES, NEW AIRPORTS, NEW SCHOOLS, NEW HOSPITALS. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SQUANDERED ON SO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND I THINK I DID A GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST DISASTERS. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I HOPE THE FACT CHECKERS ARE TURNING UP THE VOLUME AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU STARTED THE IRAN DEAL. THAT'S ANOTHER BEAUTY WHERE YOU HAVE A COUNTRY THAT WAS READY TO FALL, I MEAN, IT WAS DOING SO BADLY, THEY WERE CHOKING ON TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU LOOK AT WHAT CHINA IS DOING TO OUR COUNTRY IN TERMS OF MAKING OUR PRODUCT. THEY'RE DEVALUING THEIR CURRENCY AND THERE'S NOBODY IN OUR GOVERNMENT TO FIGHT THEM AND WE HAVE A VERY GOOD FIGHT AND WE HAVE A WINNING FIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE USING OUR COUNTRY AS A PIGGY BANK TO REBUILD CHINA AND MANY OTHER NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- EXCUSE ANY. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. AT BOTH OF OUR PLANS, HAVE CONCLUDED THAT MINE WOULD CREATE 10 MILLION JOBS AND YOURS WOULD LOSE US 3.5 MILLION JOBS AND EXPLODE THE DEBT -- >> YOU ARE GOING TO APPROVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN HISTORY. YOU'RE GOING TO APPROVE WHONE OF THE APPROVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN HISTORY. YOU'RE GOING TO COMPANIES ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS AND YOU WANT TO INCREASE THE REGULATIONS AND MAKE THEM EVEN WORSE. I'M GOING TO CUT REGULATIONS. I'M GOING TO CUT TAXES COMPANIES ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS AND YOU WANT TO INCREASE THE REGULATIONS AND MAKE THEM EVEN WORSE. I'M GOING TO CUT REGULATIONS. I'M GOING TO CUT TAXES WEBSITE. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET, BUT IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES EVEN A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S GOING TO COME CRASHING DOWN. WE ARE IN A BIG, FAT, UGLY BUBBLE, AND WE BETTER BE AWFULLY CAREFUL AND WE HAVE A FED THAT'S DOING POLITICAL THINGS. THIS JANET YELLEN OF THE FED, THE FED IS DOING POLITICAL BY KEEPING THE INTEREST RATES AT THIS LEVEL, AND BELIEVE ME, THE DAY OBAMA GOES OFF AND HE LEAVES AND GOES OUT TO THE GOLF COURSE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE TO PLAY GOLF, WHEN IRS. OTHER PEOPLE DON'T. I WILL SAY THIS. WE HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER I JUST -- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE SEEN ME. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU DECIDED TO STAY HOME AND THAT'S OKAY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER AND I'VE MET SOME OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE I'LL EVER MEET WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY UPSET WITH WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE TOLD THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. HOW MUCH WILL WE DO? THAT'S WHY I WAS SO SHOCKED WHEN DONALD PUBLICLY INVITED PUTIN SITTING ON THEIR BED THAT WEIGHS 400 POUNDS. OKAY? YOU DON'T KNOW WHO BROKE INTO DNC, BUT WHAT DID WE LEARN WITH DNC? WE LEARNED THAT BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY YOUR WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON CREATED A VACUUM THE WAY THEY GOT OUT OF IRAQ BECAUSE THEY GOT AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY -- >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER SAILORS WHO WERE ON A NEARBY SHIP. HE SAID, YOU KNOW, IF THEY TAUNTED OUR SAILORS, I'D BLOW THEM OUT OF THE WATER AND START ANOTHER WAR. THAT'S -- >> THAT WOULD NOT START A WAR. >> THAT'S NOT THEIR HANDS ON ANY NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SO A MAN WHO CAN BE THEIR HANDS ON ANY NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SO A MAN WHO CAN BE PROVOKED BY A TWEET SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS FINGERS ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUCLEAR CODES AS FAR AS I THINK ANYONE WITH ANY SENSE ABOUT THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNED. >> GETTING A LITTLE SAYING WORDS MATTER. WORDS MATTER WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND THEY REALLY MATTER WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT. AND I WANT TO REASSURE OUR ALLIES IN JAPAN, THAT. AND DONALD NEVER TELLS YOU WHAT HE WOULD DO. WOULD HE HAVE STARTED A WAR? WOULD HE HAVE BOMBED IRAN? IF HE'S GOING TO CRITICIZE A DEAL THAT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN GIVING US ACCESS TO IRANIAN FACILITIES THAT WE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE DEFENDING THEM AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY NOT SO MUCH. SO, FORD IS LEAVING, YOU SEE THAT. SUPERPOWER OF THE 21st CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY LEAVING. THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- EXCUSE ANY. I WILL BRING BACK JOBS. YOU CAN'T BRING BACK JOBS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY, I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS QUITE A BIT. >> YEAH, FOR 30 YEARS. >> I HAVE -- WELL, NOT THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. SAID IT WAS THE FINEST DEAL YOU'VE EVER SEEN. YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID ABOUT IT AND YOU WERE AGAINST IT. >> DONALD, I KNOW YOU LIVE IN YOUR OWN REALITY -- >> OH, YEAH. WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE DONE. >> MY REFERENCE WAS WHAT YOU HAD SAID IN MY QUESTION WAS -- >> YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT I SAID. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. DEFENDING THEM AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS NOT SO MUCH. SO, FORD IS LEAVING, YOU SEE THAT. THEIR SMALL CARDI NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN TO SECRETARY CLINTON, IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY SOME AND MAKE SOME MONEY. WELL, IT DID COLLAPSE. ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 TRADE DEAL SIGNED ANYWHERE, IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW YOU WANT TO APPROVE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF IT THEN HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING HOW BAD IT IS AND SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE. YUAN IF Y YOU KNOW IF YOU DID WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE AND PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT BOTH OF OUR PLANS, HAVE CONCLUDED THAT MINE WOULD CREATE 10 MILLION JOBS AND YOURS WOULD LOSE US 3.5 MILLION JOBS AND EXPLODE THE DEBT -- >> YOU ARE GOING TO APPROVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN HISTORY. INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T PAY ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. >> THAT MAKES ME SMART. >> IF HE'S PAID ZERO, THAT MEANS ZERO FOR TROOPS, ZERO FOR VETS, >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN PRESIDENT. OVER -- ALMOST 4,000 PEOPLE IN CHICAGO HAVE BEEN KILLED. WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER. NOW, WHETHER OR NOT IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO YOU DO STOP AND FRISK, WHICH WORKED VERY WELL, MAYOR GIULIANI IS HERE, IT WORKED VERY WELL IN NEW YORK. IT BROUGHT THE CRIME THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND IN PART BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND I THINK I DID A GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, ON THIS DEBATE STAGE AND LESTER HOLT WAS GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE RACIST BIRTHER LIE TO BED. TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG RECORD OF ENGAGING IN RACIST BEHAVIOR. WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION. WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. >> 2002 -- >> THAT IS A I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. JUST SO YOU PUT IT OUT. I KNOW HOW TO WIN. SHE DOES NOT -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON? >> WAIT. THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU. BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? SO, FORD IS LEAVING, YOU SEE THAT. BUT THE POLITICIANS HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, LESTER, HOW MUCH? >> IT S AS I SAID, TRUMPED UP TRICKLE DOWN. TRICKLE DOWN DID NOT AND STOP AND FRISK BROUGHT IT DOWN TO 500 MURDERS. OF MURDERS. HARD TO BELIEVE. TO BE GOOD? BUT WE WENT FROM 2,200 TO 500 AND IT WAS CONTINUED ON BY MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND IT WAS TERMINATED BY CURRENT MAYOR. BUT STOP AND FRISK HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE SAFETY OF NEW YORK CITY, TREMENDOUS BEYOND BELIEF. SO WHEN YOU SAY IT HAS NO IMPACT, IT REALLY DID. IT HAD A VERY, VERY BIG IMPACT. >> WELL, IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY, IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS, THAT UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR, CRIME PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO. SO MANY HUNDREDS AND BEEN SQUANDERED ON SO MANY OF YOUR IDEAS. AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO HAPPEN. UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG BUSINESSES. THAT'S GOING TO BE A JOB CREATOR LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE RONALD REAGAN. IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH. COMPANIES WILL COME. THEY WILL BUILD. THEY WILL EXPAND. NEW COMPANIES WILL START. AND I LOOK VERY, VERY MUCH FORWARD TO DOING IT. WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS PLACE. INDEPENDENT EXPERTS HAVE LOOKED AT WHAT I'VE PROPOSED AND LOOKED AT WHAT DONALD'S PROPOSED AND BASICALLY THEY'VE SAID THIS. THAT IF HIS TAX PLAN, WHICH WOULD BLOW UP THE DEBT BY OVER $5 TRILLION AND WOULD, IN SOME INSTANCES, DISADVANTAGE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES COMPARED TO THE WEALTHY, WERE TO GO YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. >> I'VE BEEN SECRETARY OF STATE. >> EXCUSE ME, YOUR HUSBAND SIGNED NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. >> THAT IS YOUR OPINION. >> YOU GO TO NEW ENGLAND, GO TO OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, YOU GO TO ANYWHERE YOU WANT, SECRETARY CLINTON, AND YOU WILL SEE DEVASTATION WHERE MANUFACTURERS DOWN TAX PROPOSALS. I DON'T SEE CHANGES IN THE CORPORATE TAX RATES OR THE KINDS OF PROPOSALS YOU'RE REFERRING TO THAT WOULD CAUSE THE ECONOMY. BROAD-BASED INCLUSIVE GROWTH IS WHAT WE NEED IN AMERICA. NOT MORE ADVANTAGES FOR PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> TYPICAL POLITICIAN. ALL TALK, NO ACTION. SOUNDS GOOD, DOESN'T WORK. NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. OUR COUNTRY IS SUFFERING BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE SECRETARY CLINTON HAVE MADE SUCH BELIEVE ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET, BUT IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES EVEN A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S GOING TO COME CRASHING DOWN. WE ARE IN A BIG, FAT, UGLY BUBBLE, AND WE BETTER BE AWFULLY CAREFUL AND WE HAVE A FED THAT'S DOING POLITICAL THINGS. THIS JANET YELLEN OF THE FED, THE FED IS WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A WE'RE A DEBTOR NATION.

AND WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SQUANDERED ON SO MANY OF YOUR IDEAS. >> LET YOU RESPOND -- >> MAYBE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T PAID ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX FOR A LOT OF YEARS AND THE WE NEED TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR WHETHER IT'S RUSSIA, CHINA, IRAN OR ANYBODY ELSE, THE UNITED STATES HAS MUCH GREATER CAPACITY AND WE ARE NOT GOING UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY SOME AND MAKE SOME MONEY. WELL, IT DID COLLAPSE. >> THAT'S CALLED BUSINESS, BY THE WAY. >> 9 MILLION PEOPLE, 9 MILLION PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS. THEIR HOMES AND $13 >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT.

SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL BUT WE HAVE NO LEADERSHIP AND HONESTLY, THAT STARTS WITH SECRETARY CLINTON. >> ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE IS TWO MINUTES OF THE SAME QUESTION TO DEFEND TAX INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY TOP. >> MR. TRUMP -- RETURNS AGAINST MY FOREIGN BANKS.

UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG BUSINESSES. THAT'S GOING TO BE A JOB CREATOR LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE RONALD REAGAN. IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH. COMPANIES WILL COME. THEY WILL BUILD. THEY WILL EXPAND. NEW COMPANIES WILL START. AND I LOOK VERY, VERY MUCH FORWARD TO DOING IT. WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS THEY'RE GONE.

FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID >> THAT CAN'T BE LEFT -- >> PLEASE, TAKE 30 SECONDS. INNER CITIES AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS AND IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL BUT WE HAVE NO LEADERSHIP AND HONESTLY, THAT STARTS WITH SECRETARY CLINTON. >> ALL RIGHT.

AND THE KIND OF PLAN AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAN WE'VE EVER HAD. PERSPECTIVES. I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW, DONALD WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN HIS LIFE AND THAT'S ALL TO DO AND I AM DETERMINED THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE ECONOMY REALLY MOVING AGAIN. BUILDING ON THE SEMI-EXACT. SO I WILL TELL YOU THIS. WE HAVE TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB AT KEEPING OUR JOBS AND WE HAVE TO DO A MUCH BETTER TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON. NOW, LOOK, WE HAVE THE WORST REVIVAL OF AN ECONOMY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND BELIEVE ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET, BUT IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES EVEN A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S GOING TO COME CRASHING DOWN. WE ARE IN A BIG, FAT, UGLY BUBBLE, AND WE BETTER BE AWFULLY CAREFUL AND WE HAVE A FED THAT'S DOING POLITICAL THINGS. THIS JANET YELLEN OF THE FED, THE FED IS OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE FACILITY. IT IMMEDIATELY WAS PUT TO USE. AND YOU WOULDN'T PAY WHAT THE MAN NEEDED TO BE PAID WHAT HE WAS COMPANY, BUT ON OCCASION, FOUR TIMES, BUT REMEMBER, DONALD STARTED HIS CAREER BACK IN 1973 BEING SUED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE DEALS. WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AGREE THAT THIS SHOULD BE DONE. $2.5 TRILLION. I HAPPEN TO THINK IT'S DOUBLE THAT. PROBABLY $5 TRILLION THAT WE CAN BRING INTO OUR COUNTRY, LESTER, AND WITH A LITTLE LEADERSHIP YOU'D GET IT IN HERE VERY QUICKLY AND IT COULD BE PUT TO USE ON THE INNER CITIES AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS AND IT THIS JANET YELLEN OF THE FED, THE FED IS DOING POLITICAL BY KEEPING THE INTEREST RATES AT THIS LEVEL, AND BELIEVE ME, THE DAY OBAMA GOES OFF AND HE LEAVES AND GOES OUT TO THE GOLF COURSE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE TO PLAY GOLF, WHEN THEY RAISE INTEREST RATES, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME VERY BAD THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE THE FED IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB. BACKS OF LITTLE GUYS, AND INDEED, I HAVE MET A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE STIFFED BY YOU AND YOUR BUSINESSES, DONALD. I'VE MET DISHWASHERS, PAINTERS, ARCHITECTS, GLASS INSTALLERS, MARBLE INSTALLERS, DRAPERY INSTALLERS LIKE MY DAD WAS, WHO YOU REFUSED TO PAY NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN ABOUT IT. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY SOME AND MAKE SOME MONEY. WELL, IT DID COLLAPSE. CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY THE CHINESE. I THINK IT'S REAL. >> I DID NOT. >> SCIENCE IS REAL. >> I DID NOT SAY THAT. >> AND I THINK -- THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 HUSBAND SIGNED NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. >> THAT IS YOUR OPINION. >> YOU GO TO NEW ENGLAND, GO TO OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, YOU GO TO ANYWHERE YOU WANT, SECRETARY CLINTON, AND YOU WILL SEE DEVASTATION WHERE MANUFACTURERS DOWN NA N NAFTA IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL SIGNED ANYWHERE, IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW YOU WANT TO APPROVE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF IT THEN HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING HOW BAD IT IS AND SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE. YUAN IF Y YOU KNOW IF YOU DID WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD >> DONALD, I KNOW YOU LIVE IN YOUR OWN REALITY -- >> OH, YEAH. >> -- THAT IS NOT THE FACTS. I DID SAY, I HOPED IT WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL. WHEN IT WAS NEGOTIATED -- WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PAY ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. >> THAT MAKES ME SMART. >> IF HE'S PAID ZERO, THAT MEANS ZERO FOR TROOPS, ZERO FOR VETS, YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER TAKING THE 5th, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND BELIEVE ME, THIS COUNTRY THINKS IT'S -- THEM TO DO. WE HAVE AN ARCHITECT IN THE AUDIENCE WHO DESIGNED ONE OF YOUR CLUBHOUSES AT ONE OF YOUR GOLF COURSES. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FACILITY. IT IMMEDIATELY WAS PUT TO USE. AND YOU WOULDN'T PAY WHAT THE MAN NEEDED TO BE PAID WHAT HE WAS AND NO-FLY LISTS. I AGREE WITH YOU, WHEN A PERSON IS ON A WATCH LIST OR NO-FLY LIST, AND I HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE NRA, WHICH I'M VERY PROUD OF. THESE ARE VERY, VERY GOOD PEOPLE AND THEY'RE PROTECTING THE THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND I THINK I DID A GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG RECORD OF ENGAGING IN RACIST BEHAVIOR. LOT OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION. WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. JUDGMENT ANY -- >> THE RECORD SHOWS THAT I'M RIGHT. WHEN I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD STERN, VERY LIKELY FIRST TIME ANYONE'S ASKED ME THAT, I SAID, VERY LIKEL LI ASKED ME THAT, I SAID, VERY LIKEL GHTLY, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE, WHO KNOWS, ESSENTIALLY. I THEN DID AN INTERVIEW WITH NEIL CAVUTO, TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY IS MORE IMPORTANT. I SPOKE TO SEAN HANNITY, EVERYBODY REFUSES TO CALL SEAN HANNITY. I HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. I SAID, THERE'S A >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. >> I'VE BEEN SECRETARY OF STATE. >> EXCUSE ME, YOUR HUSBAND SIGNED NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. >> THAT IS YOUR OPINION. >> YOU GO TO NEW ENGLAND, GO TO OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, YOU GO TO ANYWHERE YOU WANT, SECRETARY CLINTON, AND YOU WILL SEE DEVASTATION WHERE MANUFACTURERS DOWN >> EDUCATE -- OH, I DO. >> SECRETARY, YOU HAVE NO PLAN. >> I'VE WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT IT. IT'S CALLED \"STRONGER I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING HE LEAVES AND GOES OUT TO THE GOLF COURSE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE TO PLAY GOLF, WHEN THEY RAISE INTEREST RATES, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME VERY BAD THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE THE FED IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB. THE FED IS BEING MORE SHOOTINGS. I SAY, WHERE IS THIS? IS THIS A WAR-TORN COUNTRY? WHAT ARE WE DOING? NOW, I BELIEVE IN COMMUNITY POLICING AND, IN FACT, VIOLENT IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG THIS ANSWER GOES TO YOU. >> WELL, I THINK CYBER RADICALIZE, EVEN DIRECT PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY AND EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, BUT WE ALSO SAYING AND MY CRITICISM OF NATO. I THINK WE HAVE TO GET NATO TO GO INTO THE MIDDLE EAST WITH US IN BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT. >> WHO HAVE SAID WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE I THINK MY HUSBAND DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN THE 1990s. I THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WORKED AND HOW -- MAKE THEM EVEN WORSE. I'M GOING TO CUT REGULATIONS. I'M GOING TO CUT TAXES INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE FED, THE FED IS DOING POLITICAL BY KEEPING THE INTEREST RATES AT THIS LEVEL, AND BELIEVE ME, THE DAY OBAMA GOES OFF AND HE LEAVES AND GOES OUT TO THE GOLF COURSE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE TO PLAY GOLF, WHEN THEY RAISE INTEREST RATES, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME VERY BAD THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE THE FED IS NOT DOING THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I ALSO HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE HAS. YOU KNOW? I HAVE A MUCH BETTER -- SHE SPENT, LET ME TELL YOU, SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ADVERTISING -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT.

THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAN WE'VE EVER HAD. THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU'RE LOOKING TO DO WITH $20 TRILLION IN DEBT. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FROM THE TIME THEY'VE COME IN IS OVER 230 YEARS' WORTH OF DEBT AND HE'S TOPPED IT. HE'S DOUBLED IT IN A COURSE OF ALMOST EIGHT YEARS. SEMI-EXACT. SO I WILL TELL YOU THIS. WE HAVE TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB AT KEEPING OUR JOBS AND WE HAVE TO DO A MUCH BETTER THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. >> I'VE BEEN SECRETARY OF STATE. >> EXCUSE ME, YOUR HUSBAND SIGNED NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. >> THAT IS YOUR OPINION. >> YOU GO TO NEW ENGLAND, GO TO OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, YOU GO TO ANYWHERE YOU WANT, SECRETARY CLINTON, AND YOU WILL SEE DEVASTATION WHERE MANUFACTURERS DOWN NA N NAFTA IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL SIGNED ANYWHERE, IN THIS COUNTRY.

NO WONDER YOU'VE, TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE.

I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. RETURNS, BUT EVERYONE HAS DONE IT. WE KNOW THE IRS HAS MADE CLEAR THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER IN CHICAGO, THEY'VE HAD THOUSANDS OF SHOOTINGS, THOUSANDS SINCE JANUARY 1st. THOUSANDS OF SHOOTINGS. I SAY, WHERE IS THIS? IS THIS A WAR-TORN COUNTRY? WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER. IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO WHERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED. THOUSANDS OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. IN FACT, ALMOST 4,000 HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE BARACK OBAMA BECAME INCARCERATED. SO WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE CANNOT JUST SAY LAW AND ORDER. WE HAVE TO SAY WE -- WE HAVE TO COME FORWARD WITH A PLAN THAT IS GOING TO DIVERT PEOPLE FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, DEAL WITH AND I WILL TELL YOU, YOU LOOK AT THE INNER CITIES AND I JUST LEFT DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND I JUST -- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE SEEN ME. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU DECIDED TO STAY HOME AND THAT'S OKAY. THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. IMPORTANT TO THE COUNTRY. >> I'LL LET YOU RESPOND. THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT GOT HIM TO PRODUCE THE DISASTERS. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I HOPE THE FACT CHECKERS ARE TURNING UP THE VOLUME AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. ADDITION TO SURROU SURROUNDING NATIONS AND WE HAVE TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS AND WE HAVE TO DO IT FAST. WHEN ISIS FORMED IN THIS VACUUM CREATED BY BARACK OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON, AND SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, NEARBY SHIP. HE SAID, YOU KNOW, IF THEY TAUNTED OUR SAILORS, I'D BLOW THEM OUT OF THE WATER AND START ANOTHER WAR. THAT'S -- >> THAT WOULD NOT START A WAR. >> THAT'S NOT JUDGMENT. THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT TEMPERAMENT TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. TO BE TAUNTED. AND THE WORST PART -- >> NO, THEY WERE TAUNTING US. >> -- I HEARD DONALD SAY HAS BEEN ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY YOU KNOW, THAT'S FINE, YOU KNOW. >> WRONG. >> HAVE A GOOD TIME, FOLKS. AND, IN FACT, HIS CAVALIER ATTITUDE ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS SO DEEPLY TROUBLING. THAT IS THE NUMBER-ONE THREAT WE FACE IN THE WORLD AND IT BECOMES PARTICULARLY THREATENING IF TERRORISTS EVER GET THEIR HANDS ON ANY NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SO A MAN WHO CAN BE PROVOKED BY A TWEET SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS FINGERS ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUCLEAR CODES AS FAR AS I THINK ANYONE WITH ANY SENSE ABOUT THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNED. A WAR? WOULD HE HAVE BOMBED IRAN? IF HE'S GOING TO CRITICIZE A DEAL THAT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN GIVING US ACCESS TO IRANIAN FACILITIES THAT WE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO AND HAS BECOME A U.S. CITIZEN AND YOU CAN BET SHE'S GOING TO VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. >> OKAY. GOOD. LET ME JUST TELL YOU -- >> MR. TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT NICE. BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE ADS ON ME. MANY OF WHICH ARE DON'T EVEN KNOW. >> WILL YOU ACCEPT THE OUTCOME OF THE ZPL ELECTION? >> I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE >> I HAVE -- WELL, NOT QUITE THAT LONG. I THINK MY HUSBAND DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN THE 1990s. I THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WORKED AND HOW -- MAKE THEM EVEN WORSE. I'M GOING TO CUT REGULATIONS. I'M GOING TO CUT TAXES INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WILL REALLY BOOST THE ECONOMY. BROAD-BASED INCLUSIVE GROWTH IS WHAT WE NEED IN AMERICA. THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS I HAVE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. MY FATHER WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. HE WORKED REALLY HARD. HE PRINTED DRAPERY FABRICS ON LONG TABLES WHERE HE PULLED OUT THOSE FABRICS AND HE WENT DOWN WITH A SILK START ON THAT, MY FATHER GAVE ME A VERY SMALL LOAN IN 1975 AND I BUILT IT INTO A COMPANY THAT'S WORTH MANY, MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH SOME OF AND STREAMLINE THEM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. WHAT I HAVE PROPOSED WOULD BE PAID FOR BY RAISING TAXES ON THE WEALTHY BECAUSE THEY HAVE MADE ALL THE GAINS IN THE ECONOMY >> WHY NOT, YEAH. WHY NOT. BELIEVE ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET, BUT IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES EVEN A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S GOING TO COME CRASHING DOWN. WE ARE IN A BIG, FAT, UGLY BUBBLE, AND WE BETTER BE AWFULLY YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE UNFORTUNATELY, RACE STILL DETERMINES TOO MUCH. OFTEN DETERMINES WHERE PEOPLE LIVE, DETERMINES WHAT KIND OF EDUCATION IN THEIR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEY CAN GET, AND, YES, IT DETERMINES HOW THEY'RE TREATED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE'VE JUST SEEN THOSE POLICE ARE IMPLICITLY BIASED AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE? >> LESTER, I THINK IMPLICIT BIAS IS A PROBLEM FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST POLICE. I THINK, UNFORTUNATELY, TOO MANY OF US IN OUR BIG IMPACT. >> WELL, IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY, IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS, THAT UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR, CRIME HAS CONTINUED TO DROP >> MR. TRUMP, FOR FIVE YEARS, YOU PERPETUATED A FALSE CLAIM OF THE RESPOND. THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG LOT OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE IF SHE EVER WINS THIS RACE, THEY WON'T BE TAKEN CARE OF. >> MR. TRUMP, THIS YEAR SECRETARY CLINTON RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT. >> WHO HAVE SAID WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON. NOW, LOOK, WE HAVE THE WORST REVIVAL OF AN ECONOMY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND BELIEVE ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET, BUT IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES EVEN A LITTLE TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY INVESTMENTS WHERE WE CAN GROW THE ECONOMY. TAKE CLEAN ENERGY. SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21st CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY THE CHINESE. I THINK IT'S REAL. >> I DID NOT. >> SCIENCE IS REAL. >> I DID NOT SAY THAT. >> AND I THINK -- BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- EXCUSE ANY. I WILL BRING BACK JOBS. YOU CAN'T BRING BACK JOBS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY, I TRADE DEAL SIGNED ANYWHERE, IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW YOU WANT TO APPROVE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF IT THEN HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING HOW BAD IT IS AND SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE. YUAN IF Y YOU KNOW IF YOU DID WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. SAID IT WAS THE FINEST REGULATIONS. I'M GOING TO CUT TAXES BIG LEAGUE AND YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE TAXES BIG LEAGUE. END OF STORY. >> LET ME GET YOU TO PAUSE RIGHT THERE. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT SEGMENT. WE'RE GOING TO TALK -- >> THAT CAN'T BE LEFT -- >> PLEASE, TAKE 30 SECONDS. >> I KIND OF ASSUMED THAT THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF THESE CHARGES AND CLAIMS AND SO -- >> FACTS. >> -- WE HAVE TAKEN THE HOME PAGE OF MY WEBSITE, HILLARYCLINTON.COM AND TURNED IT INTO A FACT CHECKER SO IF YOU WANT TO SEE IN REALTIME WEBSITE. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS EVENING I'M GOING TO BE BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED. >> WHY NOT. >> WHY NOT, YEAH. WHY NOT. YOU KNOW, JUST JOIN THE DEBATE BY SAYING MORE CRAZY THINGS. NOW -- >> HEY, THERE'S NOTHING CRAZY ABOUT NOT LETTING OUR COMPANIES BRING THEIR >> HOW MUCH, HOW MUCH? LESTER, HOW MUCH? >> IT S AS I SAID, TRUMPED UP TRICKLE DOWN. TRICKLE DOWN DID NOT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WILL REALLY BOOST THE ECONOMY. BROAD-BASED INCLUSIVE GROWTH IS WHAT WE NEED IN AMERICA. NOT MORE ADVANTAGES FOR PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> TYPICAL POLITICIAN. ALL TALK, NO ACTION. SOUNDS GOOD, DOESN'T WORK. NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. OUR COUNTRY IS BELIEVE ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET, BUT IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES EVEN A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S GOING TO COME CRASHING DOWN. WE ARE IN A BIG, FAT, UGLY BUBBLE, AND WE BETTER BE AWFULLY CAREFUL AND WE HAVE A FED THAT'S DOING POLITICAL THINGS. THIS JANET YELLEN OF THE FED, THE FED IS DOING POLITICAL BY KEEPING THE INTEREST RATES AT THIS LEVEL, AND BELIEVE ME, THE DAY OBAMA GOES OFF AND HE LEAVES AND GOES OUT TO THE GOLF COURSE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE TO PLAY GOLF, WHEN THEY RAISE INTEREST RATES, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME VERY BAD THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE THE FED IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB. YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN TAX RETURNS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING HE'S HIDING. ANDGUESSING AT WHAT IT MIGHT BE THAT HE'S HIDING BUT I THINK THE QUESTION IS WERE HE EVER TO GET NEAR THE RETURNS, YOU DON'T LEARN THAT MUCH FROM TAX RETURNS. THAT I CAN TELL YOU. YOU LEARN A LOT FROM FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. AND YOU SHOULD GO DOWN AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. THE OTHER THING, I'M EXTREMELY UNDERLEVERAGED. THE REPORT THAT SAID $650 MILLION WHICH, BY THE WAY, A LOT OF FRIENDS OF MINE THAT KNOW MY BUSINESS SAYS BOY, THAT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY RELATIVE TO WHAT I HAD. THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE IN QUESTION, THEY SAID IN THE SAME REPORT WHICH WAS HAVE CAUSED THIS PROBLEM. OUR COUNTRY HAS TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS. WE'RE A DEBTOR NATION. WE'RE A SERIOUS DEBTOR NATION. AND WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT NEEDS NEW ROADS, NEW TUNNELS, NEW BRIDGES, NEW AIRPORTS, NEW SCHOOLS, NEW HOSPITALS. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SQUANDERED ON SO MANY OF YOUR IDEAS. >> LET YOU RESPOND -- WORK THAT YOU ASKED THEM TO DO. WE HAVE AN ARCHITECT IN THE AUDIENCE WHO OF THE LAWS OF THE NATION BECAUSE I'M RUNNING A COMPANY, MY OBLIGATION RIGHT NOW IS TO DO WELL FOR MYSELF, MY FAMILY, MY EMPLOYEES, FOR MY COMPANIES AND THAT'S WHAT I DO. BUT WHAT SHE DOESN'T SAY IS THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLY HAPPY AND THEY LOVE DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND I JUST -- YOU KNOW, THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE RESPOND. THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT REALLY WANTED ME TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND I THINK I DID A GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT EVEN FOR THE PRESIDENT IN GETTING HIM TO PRODUCE HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HEARD. AND CLEARLY AS DONALD JUST ADMITTED, HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO STAND ON THIS DEBATE STAGE AND LESTER HOLT WAS GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE RACIST BIRTHER LIE TO BED. IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT WAS NOT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR IT, BUT HE PERSISTED. HE PERSISTED YEAR AFTER YEAR BECAUSE SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS, PEOPLE THAT HE WAS TRYING TO PEOPLE. I NOTICE YOU BRING THAT UP A LOT, AND, YOU KNOW, I ALSO I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA. COULD ALSO BE LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. ALSO COULD BE SOMEBODY SITTING ON THEIR BED THAT WEIGHS 400 POUNDS. OKAY? YOU DON'T KNOW WHO BROKE INTO DNC, BUT WHAT DID WE LEARN WITH DNC? WE LEARNED THAT BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY YOUR PEOPLE. BY DEBBIE WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. BUT BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. NOW, WHETHER THAT WAS RUSSIA, WHETHER THAT WAS CHINA, WHETHER IT WAS ANOTHER COUNTRY, WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, UNDER I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA. COULD ALSO BE LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. ALSO COULD BE SOMEBODY SITTING ON THEIR BED THAT WEIGHS 400 POUNDS. OKAY? YOU DON'T KNOW WHO BROKE INTO DNC, BUT WHAT DID WE LEARN WITH DNC? WE LEARNED THAT BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY YOUR PEOPLE. BY DEBBIE WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. BUT BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. NOW, WHETHER THAT WAS RUSSIA, WHETHER THAT WAS CHINA, WHETHER IT WAS ANOTHER COUNTRY, WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, UNDER POINT PRETTY SOON THE WAY THEY'RE GOING. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT NATO, I WAS ASKED ON A MAJOR SHOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF NATO? YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, I'M A BUSINESSPERSON. I DID REALLY WELL, BUT I HAVE COMMON SENSE. AND I SAID, WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, I HAVEN'T GIVEN LOTS OF THOUGHT TO NATO, BUT TWO THINGS. NUMBER ONE, THE 28 COUNTRIES OF NATO, MANY OF THEM AREN'T PAYING THEIR FAIR AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET, MAYBE BY FAR, IS MY TEMPERAMENT. I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT. I KNOW HOW TO WIN. SHE DOES NOT -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON? >> WAIT. THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. I SAID, THERE'S A THEIR HANDS ON ANY NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SO A MAN WHO CAN BE PROVOKED BY A TWEET SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS FINGERS ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUCLEAR CODES AS FAR AS I THINK ANYONE WITH ANY SENSE ABOUT THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNED. >> GETTING A LITTLE TO END IT, JUST GET RID OF IT, BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT DO FIRST STRIKE. I THINK THAT ONCE THE NUCLEAR ALTERNATIVE HAPPENS, IT'S OVER. SAYING WORDS MATTER. WORDS MATTER WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND THEY REALLY MATTER WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT. AND I WANT TO REASSURE OUR ALLIES IN JAPAN, IN SOUTH KOREA, AND ELSEWHERE THAT WE HAVE MUTUAL DEFENSE TREATIES AND WE WILL HONOR THEM. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT AMERICA'S WORD BE GOOD AND SO I KNOW THAT THIS CAMPAIGN HAS CAUSED SOME QUESTIONING AND SOME WORRIES ON THE PART OF MANY LEADERS ACROSS THE GLOBE. I'VE TALKED WITH A NUMBER OF THEM, BUT I WANT TO, ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT BY A MAJOR PARTY. EARLIER THIS MONTH YOU SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE, \"A PRESIDENTIAL LOOK.\" SHE'S STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE STAMINA. TO BE PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY, YOU NEED TREMENDOUS STAMINA. >> THE QUOTE WAS \"I JUST DON'T THINK SHE HAS -- >> WAIT A MINUTE. YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION. DID SHE ASK ME A QUESTION? YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ON TRADE THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT. >> WHO HAVE SAID WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT NICE. BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE ADS ON ME. MANY OF WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE, THEY'RE UNTRUE AND MISREPRESENTATIONS. I WILL FELL YOU THIS, LESTER. IT'S NOT NICE AND I DON'T -- I DON'T DESERVE THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NICE THING THAT SHE'S DONE. IT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ADS AND THE ONLY GRATIFYING THING IS I SAW THE POLLS COME IN TODAY AND WITH ALL OF THAT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS YOU KNOW, DONALD WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN HIS LIFE AND THAT'S ALL TO HIS BENEFIT. START ON THAT, MY FATHER GAVE ME A VERY SMALL LOAN IN 1975 AND I BUILT IT INTO A COMPANY THAT'S WORTH NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? >> I HAVE -- WELL, NOT QUITE THAT LONG. I THINK MY HUSBAND DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN THE 1990s. I THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WORKED AND HOW -- >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. N NAFTA IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL SIGNED ANYWHERE, IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW YOU WANT TO APPROVE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF IT THEN HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING HOW BAD IT IS AND SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE. YUAN IF Y YOU KNOW IF YOU DID WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. SAID IT WAS THE FINEST DEAL YOU'VE EVER SEEN. DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING INNER CITIES AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS AND IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL BUT WE HAVE NO LEADERSHIP AND HONESTLY, THAT STARTS WITH SECRETARY CLINTON. >> ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE IS TWO MINUTES OF THE SAME QUESTION TO DEFEND TAX INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS EVENING I'M GOING TO BE BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED. >> WHY NOT. >> WHY NOT, YEAH. WHY NOT. INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY >> MR. TRUMP -- >> TYPICAL POLITICIAN. ALL TALK, NO ACTION. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> TYPICAL POLITICIAN. ALL TALK, NO ACTION. THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER AND INDEED, I HAVE MET A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE STIFFED BY YOU AND YOUR BUSINESSES, DONALD. THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. >> ALL RIGHT, MR. TRUMP, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE? >> FIRST OF ALL, SECRETARY CLINTON DOESN'T WANT TO USE A COUPLE OF WORDS AND THAT'S LAW AND ORDER. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE OUR INNER CITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, THIS AT HIS RALLIES AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PAINTS SUCH A DIRE THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND IN PART BECAUSE IT WAS INEFFECTIVE. THE FACT THAT YOU WERE THE ONE THAT BROUGHT UP THE WORD, THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON CREATED A VACUUM THE WAY THEY GOT OUT OF IRAQ BECAUSE THEY GOT OUT WRONG. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN. ONCE THEY GOT IN, THE HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE CONSTANTLY, IS GEORGE W. BUSH MADE THE AGREEMENT ABOUT WHEN RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. FAILED US IN THE FIRST PLACE. INDEPENDENT EXPERTS HAVE LOOKED AT WHAT I'VE PROPOSED AND LOOKED AT WHAT DONALD'S PROPOSED AND BASICALLY THEY'VE SAID THIS. THAT IF HIS TAX PLAN, WHICH WOULD BLOW UP THE DEBT BY OVER $5 TRILLION AND WOULD, IN SOME INSTANCES, DISADVANTAGE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES COMPARED TO THE WEALTHY, WERE TO GO CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. SAID IT WAS THE FINEST AND CLAIMS AND SO -- >> FACTS. >> -- WE HAVE TAKEN THE HOME PAGE OF MY WEBSITE, I THINK I SHOULD. YOU GO TO HER WEBSITE AND TAKE A LOOK AT HER GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, FIGHTING -- NO WONDER YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING ISIS YOUR ENTIRE ADULT LIFE.

YOU HAVE IS TWO MINUTES OF THE SAME QUESTION TO DEFEND TAX INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS >> WHY NOT, YEAH. WHY NOT. THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO SEE AND I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S EVER THAT YOU BUILT A LOT OF BUSINESSES ON THE BACKS OF LITTLE GUYS, AND INDEED, I HAVE MET REFUSED TO PAY THEM? I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLY HAPPY AND THEY LOVE ME. I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. WE'RE JUST OPENING UP ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE THIS WAY? BUT WHEN IT COMES TO POLICING, SINCE IT CAN HAVE LITERALLY FATAL CONSEQUENCES, I HAVE SAID IN MY FIRST BUDGET WE WOULD PUT MONEY INTO THAT BUDGET DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU DECIDED TO STAY HOME AND THAT'S OKAY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER AND I'VE MET SOME OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE I'LL EVER MEET WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY UPSET WITH WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE TOLD THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST OR WANTED TO BELIEVE IT.

WHEN ISIS FORMED IN THIS VACUUM CREATED BY THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.

AND, IN FACT, HIS CAVALIER ATTITUDE ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS SO DEEPLY TROUBLING. THAT IS THE NUMBER-ONE THREAT WE FACE IN THE WORLD AND IT BECOMES PARTICULARLY THREATENING IF TERRORISTS EVER GET THEIR HANDS ON ANY NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SO A MAN WHO CAN BE PROVOKED BY A TWEET SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS FINGERS ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUCLEAR CODES AS FAR AS I THINK ANYONE WITH ANY SENSE ABOUT THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNED. >> GETTING A LITTLE RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN GAVE THEM $150 BILLION BACK. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL, WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. AND THIS COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE. >> WE ARE AT THE -- WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION -- >> WELL, ONE THING -- >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY SOME AND MAKE SOME MONEY. WELL, IT DID COLLAPSE. >> THAT'S CALLED INVESTMENTS WHERE WE CAN GROW THE ECONOMY. TAKE CLEAN ENERGY. SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21st CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE DEVASTATION WHERE MANUFACTURERS DOWN NA I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T PAY ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. >> THAT MAKES ME SMART. >> IF HE'S PAID ZERO, THAT MEANS ZERO FOR YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER TAKING THE 5th, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND BELIEVE ME, THIS COUNTRY THINKS IT'S -- THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. WAS ON \"WOLF BLITZER\" SAYING THAT THIS HAPPENED. BLUMENTHAL SENT McCLATCHY, HIGHLY RESPECTED REPORTER, TO KENYA TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT. THEY WERE PRESSING IT VERY HARD. SHE FAILED TO GET THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. WHEN I GOT INVOLVED, I YOU RESPOND TO THAT. THERE'S A LOT THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL HEALING IN THIS SEGMENT. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICANS -- >> WELL, I WAS VERY -- I SAY NOTHING. I SAY NOTHING BECAUSE REALLY WANTED ME TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND I THINK I DID A GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, AND LESTER HOLT WAS GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE RACIST BIRTHER LIE TO BED. TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG RECORD OF ENGAGING IN RACIST BEHAVIOR. WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION. WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENTS THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAN WE'VE EVER HAD. BUT THE POLITICIANS HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- EXCUSE ANY. I WILL BRING BACK THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.

OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T PAY ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. >> THAT MAKES ME SMART. >> IF HE'S PAID ZERO, THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. >> ALL RIGHT, MR. TRUMP, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE? >> FIRST OF ALL, SECRETARY CLINTON DOESN'T WANT TO USE A COUPLE OF WORDS AND THAT'S LAW AND ORDER. VERY -- I MEAN, A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE OUR INNER CITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS, ARE LIVING IN HELL BECAUSE IT'S THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS ABOUT IT. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY SOME AND MAKE SOME MONEY. WELL, IT DID COLLAPSE. THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE HUSBAND SIGNED NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. >> THAT IS YOUR OPINION. >> YOU GO TO NEW ENGLAND, GO TO OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, YOU GO TO ANYWHERE YOU WANT, SECRETARY CLINTON, AND YOU WILL SEE DEVASTATION WHERE MANUFACTURERS DOWN SO WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST SET OF PLANS. AND PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT BOTH OF OUR PLANS, HAVE CONCLUDED THAT SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. RETURNS AGAINST MY WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU FOREIGN BANKS.

YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> ALL RIGHT, MR. TRUMP, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE? >> FIRST OF ALL, SECRETARY CLINTON DOESN'T WANT TO USE A COUPLE OF WORDS AND THAT'S LAW AND ORDER. LAW AND ORDER. NOW, WHETHER OR NOT IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO YOU DO STOP AND FRISK, WHICH WORKED VERY WELL, MAYOR GIULIANI IS HERE, IT WORKED VERY WELL IN NEW YORK. IT BROUGHT THE CRIME THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. NATURAL BORN CITIZEN. YOU QUESTIONED HIS LEGITIMACY. THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT MOST AMERICANS THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT REALLY WANTED ME TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND I THINK I DID A GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, AND LESTER HOLT WAS GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG RECORD OF ENGAGING IN RACIST BEHAVIOR. WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION. WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER PARTY. EARLIER THIS MONTH YOU SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE, \"A PRESIDENTIAL LOOK.\" SHE'S STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN YOU KNOW, DONALD WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN HIS LIFE AND THAT'S ALL TO HIS BENEFIT. CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY ECONOMY. BROAD-BASED INCLUSIVE GROWTH IS WHAT WE NEED IN AMERICA. NOT MORE ADVANTAGES FOR PEOPLE AT THE VERY TOP. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> TYPICAL POLITICIAN. ALL TALK, NO ACTION. SOUNDS GOOD, DOESN'T WORK. NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. OUR COUNTRY IS SUFFERING BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE SECRETARY CLINTON HAVE MADE SUCH ECONOMY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND BELIEVE ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET, BUT IF WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T FACILITY. IT IMMEDIATELY WAS PUT TO USE. AND YOU WOULDN'T PAY WHAT THE MAN NEEDED TO BE PAID WHAT HE WAS LEVERAGE. YOU EVEN AT ONE TIME SUGGESTED THAT YOU WOULD TRY TO NEGOTIATE COMPANY, BUT ON OCCASION, FOUR TIMES, COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY UPSET WITH WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE TOLD THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. IT. BUT REMEMBER, DONALD STARTED HIS CAREER BACK IN 1973 BEING SUED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE COUNTRY, A FEDERAL LAWSUIT, WERE SUED. WE NEED TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR WHETHER IT'S RUSSIA, CHINA, IRAN OR ANYBODY ELSE, THE UNITED STATES HAS MUCH GREATER CAPACITY THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND PERHAPS WE'RE NOT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA. COULD ALSO BE LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. ALSO COULD BE SOMEBODY SITTING ON THEIR BED AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS LIFE AND THAT'S ALL TO HIS BENEFIT. THING, AND BEFORE WE START ON THAT, MY FATHER GAVE ME A VERY ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE FACILITY. IT IMMEDIATELY WAS PUT TO USE. AND YOU WOULDN'T PAY THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING. I HAVE PUT FORTH A PLAN TO DEFEAT ISIS. IT DOES INVOLVE GOING AFTER THEM ONLINE. I THINK WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE WITH OUR TECH COMPANIES TO PREVENT ISIS AND THEIR OPERATIVES FROM BEING ABLE TO USE THE INTERNET TO RADIC RADICALIZE, EVEN DIRECT PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY AND EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO INTENSIFY OUR AIR STRIKES AGAINST ISIS AND EVENTUALLY SUPPORT OUR ARAB AND KURDISH PARTNERS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TAKE OUT ISIS IN RAQQAH, IN THEIR CLAIM OF BEING A CALIPHATE. WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. OUR MILITARY IS ASSISTING IN IRAQ AND WE'RE HOPING THAT SAY ONE THING. VERY IMPORTANT. SECRETARY CLINTON IS TALKING ABOUT TAKING OUT ISIS. WE WILL TAKE OUT ISIS. WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON CREATED A VACUUM THE WAY THEY GOT OUT OF IRAQ BECAUSE THEY GOT OUT WRONG. AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS AND I SAID IT NUMEROUS TIMES AND ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO, I READ ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" THAT NATO IS OPENING UP A MAJOR TERROR DIVISION AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT. AND I THINK WE SHOULD GET, BECAUSE WE PAY APPROXIMATELY 73% OF THE COST OF NATO, IT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE. BUT I'M ALL FOR NATO, BUT I SAID THEY HAVE TO FOCUS ON TERROR ALSO. AND THEY'RE GOING TO PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE EVEN SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THERE BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO LIFE AND THAT'S ALL TO HIS BENEFIT. THAT YOU HAVE TO COME BACK? >> WELL, FOR ONE THING, AND BEFORE WE START ON THAT, MY PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES OF STATE. >> EXCUSE ME, YOUR HUSBAND SIGNED NAFTA, ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. >> THAT IS YOUR OPINION. >> YOU GO TO NEW ENGLAND, GO TO OHIO, WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. RESPONSIBLE FOR, I CONCLUDED IT WASN'T. I WROTE ABOUT THAT -- >> SO IS IT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAULT? IS IT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAULT? >> BEFORE YOU EVEN ANNOUNCED. WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T FACILITY. IT IMMEDIATELY WAS PUT TO USE. AND YOU WOULDN'T PAY WHAT THE MAN NEEDED TO THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT GOT HIM TO PRODUCE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND I THINK I DID A GOOD JOB. SECRETARY CLINTON ALSO FOUGHT IT, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IN THE MAINSTREAM IS GOING TO SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE. SYDNEY BLUMENTHAL SENT THE REPORTER -- TAKE A LOOK AT CNN LAST WEEK, THE INTERVIEW WITH YOUR FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND SHE WAS INVOLVED. BUT JUST LIKE SHE CAN'T BRING BACK JOBS, SHE CAN'T PRODUCE. >> I'M SORRY, I'M GOING TO -- I WILL LET YOU RESPOND TO THAT. THERE'S A LOT THERE. SO WHEN SECRETARY CLINTON TALKS ABOUT THIS, I MEAN, I'LL TAKE THE ADMIRALS AND WARFARE. IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM. I HAVE A SON, HE'S 10 YEARS OLD. SHOULD BE DOING. THAT'S TRUE THROUGHOUT AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. EXPERIENCE. MY FATHER WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. HE WORKED REALLY HARD. HE PRINTED DRAPERY FABRICS ON LONG TABLES WHERE HE PULLED OUT THOSE FABRICS AND HE WENT DOWN WITH A SILK THEY PRODUCED AND THEN REFUSED TO PAY THEM? I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I'M CERTAINLY RELIEVED THAT MY LATE FATHER NEVER DID BUSINESS WITH YOU. HE PROVIDED A GOOD MIDDLE CLASS LIFE FOR US, BUT THE PEOPLE HE IT. BUT REMEMBER, DONALD STARTED HIS CAREER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. EXPERIENCE. MY FATHER WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. HE WORKED REALLY HARD. HE PRINTED DRAPERY FABRICS ON LONG TABLES WHERE HE PULLED OUT THOSE FABRICS AND HE WENT DOWN WITH A SILK THEY PRODUCED AND THEN REFUSED TO PAY THEM? I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I'M CERTAINLY RELIEVED THAT MY LATE FATHER NEVER DID BUSINESS WITH YOU. HE PROVIDED A GOOD MIDDLE CLASS LIFE FOR US, BUT THE PEOPLE HE IT. BUT REMEMBER, DONALD STARTED HIS CAREER BACK IN 1973 BEING TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? THING, AND BEFORE WE START ON THAT, MY FATHER GAVE ME A VERY SMALL LOAN IN 1975 AND I BUILT IT INTO A COMPANY THAT'S WORTH MANY, MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH SOME OF QUITE THAT LONG. I THINK MY HUSBAND DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN THE 1990s. I THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WORKED AND HOW -- >> HE APPROVED NAST  ED NAFTA, NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE THERE'S NO DOUBT NOW THAT RUSSIA HAS USED CYBER ATTACKS AGAINST ALL KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR COUNTRY AND I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. I KNOW DONALD'S VERY PRAISE WORTHY OF I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA. AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO BUT THE POLITICIANS HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, INVESTMENTS WHERE WE CAN GROW THE ECONOMY. TAKE CLEAN ENERGY. SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21st CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY THE CHINESE. I THINK IT'S REAL. >> I DID NOT. >> SCIENCE IS REAL. >> I DID NOT SAY THAT. >> AND I THINK -- >> I DO NOT SAY THAT. SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- EXCUSE ANY. I WILL BRING BACK JOBS. YOU CAN'T BRING BACK JOBS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY, I ANYWHERE, IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW YOU WANT TO APPROVE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF IT THEN HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING HOW BAD IT IS AND SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE. YUAN IF Y YOU KNOW IF YOU DID WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. SAID IT WAS THE FINEST DEAL YOU'VE EVER SEEN. YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID ABOUT IT AND YOU WERE AGAINST IT. >> DONALD, I KNOW YOU LIVE IN YOUR OWN REALITY -- >> OH, YEAH. >> -- THAT IS NOT THE FACTS. I DID SAY, I HOPED IT WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL. WHEN IT WAS NEGOTIATED -- >> NOT. >> -- WHICH I WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR, I CONCLUDED IT WASN'T. I WROTE ABOUT THAT -- >> SO IS IT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAULT? IS IT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAULT? >> BEFORE YOU EVEN ANNOUNCED. LOOK, THERE ARE -- >> SECRETARY, IS IT I'M GOING TO CUT TAXES BIG LEAGUE AND YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE TAXES BIG LEAGUE. END OF STORY. >> LET ME GET YOU TO PAUSE RIGHT THERE. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT SEGMENT. WE'RE GOING TO TALK -- >> THAT CAN'T BE LEFT -- >> PLEASE, TAKE 30 SECONDS. >> I KIND OF ASSUMED THAT THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF THESE CHARGES AND CLAIMS AND SO -- >> FACTS. >> -- WE HAVE TAKEN THE HOME PAGE OF MY WEBSITE, HILLARYCLINTON.COM AND TURNED IT INTO A FACT CHECKER SO IF YOU WANT TO SEE IN REALTIME THE END OF THIS EVENING I'M GOING TO BE BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED. >> WHY NOT. >> WHY NOT, YEAH. WHY NOT. YOU KNOW, JUST JOIN THE DEBATE BY SAYING MORE CRAZY THINGS. NOW -- >> HEY, THERE'S NOTHING CRAZY ABOUT THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN TAX RETURNS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING HE'S HIDING. ANDGUESSING AT WHAT IT MIGHT BE THAT HE'S HIDING BUT I THINK THE QUESTION IS WERE HE EVER TO GET NEAR THE RAISED THE ISSUE OF YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER TAKING THE 5th, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL EXTREMELY UNDERLEVERAGED. THE REPORT THAT SAID $650 MILLION WHICH, BY THE WAY, A LOT OF FRIENDS OF MINE THAT KNOW MY BUSINESS SAYS BOY, THAT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY RELATIVE TO WHAT I HAD. THE BUILDINGS THAT PROBLEM. OUR COUNTRY HAS TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS. WE'RE A DEBTOR NATION. WE'RE A SERIOUS DEBTOR NATION. AND WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT NEEDS NEW ROADS, NEW TUNNELS, NEW BRIDGES, NEW AIRPORTS, NEW SCHOOLS, NEW HOSPITALS. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SQUANDERED ON SO MANY OF YOUR IDEAS. >> LET YOU RESPOND -- FOLLOW-UP. STOP AND FRISK WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN NEW YORK BECAUSE IT LARGELY SINGLED OUT BLACK AND HISPANIC YOUNG MEN. >> NO, YOU'RE WRONG. IT WENT BEFORE A JUDGE WHO WAS A VERY AGAINST POLICE JUDGE. IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HER AND OUR MAYOR, OUR NEW MAYOR, REFUSED TO GO FORWARD WITH THE CASE. THEY WOULD HAVE WANTED IT REPEALED. IF YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE MANY PLACES -- >> THE ARGUMENT IS THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE RESPOND. THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT A GREAT SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT EVEN FOR THE PRESIDENT IN GETTING HIM TO PRODUCE HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HEARD. AND CLEARLY AS DONALD JUST ADMITTED, HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO STAND ON THIS DEBATE STAGE AND LESTER HOLT WAS GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE RACIST BIRTHER LIE TO BED. IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT WAS NOT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR IT, BUT HE PERSISTED. HE PERSISTED YEAR KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA. COULD ALSO BE LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. ALSO COULD BE SOMEBODY SITTING ON THEIR BED THAT WEIGHS 400 POUNDS. OKAY? YOU DON'T KNOW WHO BROKE INTO DNC, BUT WHAT DID WE LEARN WITH DNC? WE LEARNED THAT BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY YOUR PEOPLE. BY DEBBIE WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. BUT BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. NOW, WHETHER THAT WAS RUSSIA, WHETHER THAT WAS CHINA, WHETHER IT WAS ANOTHER COUNTRY, WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, UNDER ANOTHER ONE OF HER DISASTERS. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I HOPE THE FACT CHECKERS ARE TURNING UP THE VOLUME AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS LOT OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION. WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. >> 2002 -- >> THAT IS A MAINSTREAM MEDIA NONSENSE PUT OUT BY HER BECAUSE SHE FRANKLY I THINK THE BEST PERSON IN HER CAMPAIGN IS MAINSTREAM MEDIA. >> MY QUESTION -- >> WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR? I WAS AGAINST -- WAIT A MINUTE. I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. JUST SO YOU PUT IT OUT. >> THE RECORD SHOWS OTHERWISE. WHY -- >> THE RECORD DOES NOT SHOW -- >> WHY IS YOUR WHAT I SAID. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET, MAYBE BY FAR, IS MY TEMPERAMENT. THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET, MAYBE BY FAR, IS MY TEMPERAMENT. I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT. I KNOW HOW TO WIN. SHE DOES NOT -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON? >> WAIT. THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, A LOT OF THING, JUST TO RESPOND. I AGREE WITH HER ON ONE THING. THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM THE WORLD HAS IS NUCLEAR ARMAMENT, PARTY. EARLIER THIS MONTH YOU SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE, \"A PRESIDENTIAL LOOK.\" SHE'S STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA.

GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS, THAT UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR, CRIME HAS CONTINUED TO DROP WELL, JUST VERY SIMPLE TO SAY. SAYING THAT THIS HAPPENED. BLUMENTHAL SENT McCLATCHY, HIGHLY RESPECTED REPORTER, TO KENYA TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT.

GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID IT WAS TRUE. SO WHEN YOU TRY TO ACT I'LL GO ONE STEP FURTHER. IN PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, TOUGH COMMUNITY, A BRILLIANT COMMUNITY, A WEALTHY COMMUNITY, PROBABLY THE WEALTHIEST COMMUNITY THERE IS IN THE WORLD, I OPENED A CLUB AND REALLY GOT GREAT CREDIT FOR IT. NO DISCRIMINATION TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU. BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY >> LET ME LET SECRETARY CLINTON GET IN HERE. >> WELL, LET'S STOP FOR A SECOND AND REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE EIGHT YEARS AGO. WE HAD THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE GREAT RECESSION, THE WORST SINCE PRESIDENT THAT WAS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF TAX POLICIES THAT SLASHED TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, FAILED TO INVEST IN THE MIDDLE CLASS, TOOK THEIR EYES OFF OF WALL STREET, AND CREATED A PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, TAKE CLEAN ENERGY. SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21st CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY THE CHINESE. I THINK IT'S REAL. >> I DID NOT. >> SCIENCE IS REAL. >> I DID NOT SAY THAT. >> AND I THINK -- >> I DO NOT SAY THAT. >> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GRIP THIS AND DEAL WITH IT BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD AND HERE'S WHAT WE CAN DO.

SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS A POLITICAL REASON WHY YOU CAN'T SAY IT, BUT I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE -- IN NEW YORK CITY, STOP AND FRISK, CONTINUED ON BY MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND IT WAS TERMINATED BY CURRENT MAYOR. BUT STOP AND FRISK HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE SAFETY OF NEW YORK CITY, TREMENDOUS BEYOND BELIEF. SO WHEN YOU SAY IT HAS NO IMPACT, IT REALLY DID. IT HAD A VERY, VERY BIG IMPACT. >> WELL, IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY, IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS, THAT UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR, CRIME HAS CONTINUED TO DROP THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS SHOW -- >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY -- >> THE RECORD SHOWS THAT I'M RIGHT. WHEN I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD STERN, VERY LIKELY KNOWS, ESSENTIALLY. I THEN DID AN INTERVIEW WITH NEIL CAVUTO, TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY IS MORE IMPORTANT. JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES. BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST FAILED US IN THE FIRST PLACE. INDEPENDENT EXPERTS HAVE LOOKED AT WHAT I'VE PROPOSED AND LOOKED AT WHAT DONALD'S PROPOSED AND BASICALLY THEY'VE SAID THIS. THAT IF HIS TAX PLAN, WHICH WOULD BLOW UP THE DEBT BY OVER $5 TRILLION AND WOULD, IN SOME INSTANCES, DISADVANTAGE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES COMPARED TO THE WEALTHY, WERE TO GO THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. >> THAT IS YOUR OPINION. >> YOU GO TO NEW ENGLAND, GO TO OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, YOU GO TO ANYWHERE YOU WANT, SECRETARY CLINTON, AND YOU WILL SEE DEVASTATION WHERE MANUFACTURERS DOWN NA N NAFTA IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL SIGNED YOU KNOW IF YOU DID WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. SAID IT WAS THE FINEST THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING OUR TRADE DEALS. >> THE IRS SAYS AN AUDIT OF YOUR TAXES -- YOU'RE PERFECTLY FREE TO RELEASE YOUR TAXES DURING AN AUDIT. SO THE QUESTION, DOES NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T PAY ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. >> THAT MAKES ME SMART. >> IF HE'S PAID ZERO, THAT MEANS ZERO FOR WHAT THE REAL REASONS ARE BECAUSE IT MUST BE RAISED THE ISSUE OF YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th >> LET YOU RESPOND -- >> MAYBE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T PAID ANY YOU TALK ABOUT LEVERAGE. YOU EVEN AT ONE TIME SUGGESTED THAT YOU THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. RESPOND. THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION WE WILL TAKE OUT ISIS. WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON CREATED A VACUUM THE WAY THEY GOT OUT OF IRAQ BECAUSE THEY GOT NOT BARACK OBAMA. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT AMERICAN TROOPS COULD HAVE STAYED IN IRAQ IS TO GET AN AGREEMENT BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST.

TAKE CLEAN ENERGY. SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21st CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY THE CHINESE. I THINK IT'S REAL. >> I DID NOT. >> SCIENCE IS REAL. >> I DID NOT SAY THAT. >> AND I THINK -- SO I KNOW HOW TO REALLY WORK TO GET NEW JOBS AND TO GET EXPORTS THAT HELP TO CREATE MORE NEW JOBS. >> VERY QUICKLY -- >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN 30 YEARS OR 26 YEARS. >> I'VE BEEN A SENATOR, DONALD. ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T AND ORDER AND WE NEED LAW AND ORDER IN THE INNER CITIES BECAUSE THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. YOU LOOK AT CNN THIS PAST WEEK, PATTI DOYLE WAS ON \"WOLF BLITZER\" SAYING THAT THIS HAPPENED. BLUMENTHAL SENT McCLATCHY, HIGHLY RESPECTED REPORTER, TO KENYA TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT. RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY THE CHINESE. I THINK IT'S REAL. ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS.

I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. THAT WOULD ADD $5 TRILLION TO THE DEBT. >> BUT YOU HAVE NO PLAN. >> EDUCATE -- OH, I DO. >> SECRETARY, YOU HAVE FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T PAY ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. >> THAT MAKES ME SMART. >> IF HE'S PAID ZERO, THAT MEANS ZERO FOR TROOPS, ZERO FOR VETS, ZERO FOR SCHOOLS OR HEALTH, AND I THINK PROBABLY HE'S NOT ALL THAT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HAVING THE REST OF OUR COUNTRY SEE WHAT THE REAL REASONS AND I WILL TELL YOU, YOU LOOK AT THE INNER CITIES AND I JUST LEFT DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL HEALING IN THIS SEGMENT. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICANS -- >> WELL, I WAS VERY -- I SAY NOTHING.

AND CLEARLY AS DONALD JUST ADMITTED, HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO STAND ON THIS DEBATE STAGE AND LESTER HOLT WAS GOING TO BE ASKING US I DON'T THINK SO. >> MR. TRUMP, WITH A LOT OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE OTHER COUNTRIES. I WOULD LIKE EVERYBODY TO END IT, JUST GET RID OF IT, BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT DO FIRST STRIKE. I THINK THAT ONCE THE NUCLEAR ALTERNATIVE HAPPENS, IT'S OVER. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY GAVE THEM $150 BILLION BACK. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL, WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. AND THIS COUNTRY CAN'T BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY.

WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT GET TWO MINT MINUUTE MINUTES ON THIS. >> WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT. RACE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN OUR COUNTRY. UNFORTUNATELY, RACE STILL DETERMINES TOO MUCH. OFTEN DETERMINES WHERE PEOPLE LIVE, DETERMINES WHAT KIND MEAN, I CAN JUST KEEP NAMING THEM ALL DAY WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE OUR INNER CITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS, ARE LIVING IN HELL BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS, THAT UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR, CRIME HAS CONTINUED TO DROP THERE'S A LOT THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL HEALING IN THIS SEGMENT. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICANS -- >> WELL, I WAS VERY -- I SAY NOTHING. I SAY NOTHING BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO GET HIM TO PRODUCE IT. HE SHOULD HAVE PRODUCED IT A LONG TIME BEFORE. I SAY NOTHING. BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HEALING, I THINK THAT I DEVELOPED VERY, VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS OVER THE LAST LITTLE WHILE WITH >> WELL, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HEARD.

HE SAID, YOU KNOW, IF THEY TAUNTED OUR SAILORS, I'D BLOW THEM OUT OF THE WATER AND START ANOTHER WAR. THAT'S -- >> THAT WOULD NOT DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY HAPPENED. >> WHY NOT. >> WHY NOT, YEAH. WHY NOT. NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY, AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHARLOTTE, A CITY I LOVE, A CITY WHERE I HAVE INVESTMENTS, WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON THROUGHOUT VARIOUS PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY, WHETHER IT'S -- I MEAN, I CAN JUST KEEP BEEN RUSSIA. THERE'S NO DOUBT NOW THAT RUSSIA HAS USED CYBER ATTACKS AGAINST ALL KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR COUNTRY AND I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. I KNOW DONALD'S VERY THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND PERHAPS WE'RE NOT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE NOT PAYING?

SO I KNOW HOW TO REALLY WORK TO GET NEW JOBS AND TO GET EXPORTS THAT HELP TO CREATE MORE NEW JOBS. >> VERY QUICKLY -- >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN 30 YEARS OR 26 YEARS. >> I'VE BEEN A SENATOR, DONALD. >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. MANUFACTURERS DOWN NA N NAFTA IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL SIGNED ANYWHERE, IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW YOU WANT TO APPROVE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF IT THEN HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING HOW BAD IT IS AND SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE. IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS EVENING I'M GOING TO BE BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED. >> WHY NOT. >> WHY NOT, YEAH.

OUR COUNTRY IS SUFFERING BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE SECRETARY CLINTON HAVE MADE SUCH BAD DECISIONS IN TERMS OF OUR JOBS, AND IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON. NOW, LOOK, WE HAVE THE WORST REVIVAL OF AN ECONOMY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND BELIEVE ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE I GET AUDITED BY THE IRS. OTHER PEOPLE DON'T. I WILL SAY THIS. WE HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY?

WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER TRILLION, LOOKS LIKE IT'S $6 TRILLION. $6 TRILLION IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WE COULD HAVE REBUILT OUR COUNTRIES TWICE. IT'S REALLY A SHAME. IT'S POLITICIANS LIKE SECRETARY CLINTON THAT HAVE CAUSED THIS PROBLEM. OUR COUNTRY HAS TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS. WE'RE A DEBTOR NATION. WE'RE A SERIOUS DEBTOR NATION. AND WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT NEEDS NEW ROADS, NEW TUNNELS, NEW WE'RE A SERIOUS DEBTOR NATION. AND WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT NEEDS NEW ROADS, NEW TUNNELS, NEW BRIDGES, NEW AIRPORTS, NEW SCHOOLS, NEW HOSPITALS. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE LAST WEEK YOU SAID WE'VE GOT DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE POLICING TO GO RIGHT AT IMPLICIT BIAS. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT POLICE ARE IMPLICITLY BIASED AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE? >> LESTER, I THINK IMPLICIT BIAS IS A PROBLEM FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST POLICE. I THINK, FAIR TO SAY, IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS, THAT UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR, CRIME BUT I WILL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER AND I'VE MET SOME OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE I'LL EVER MEET WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY UPSET WITH WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE TOLD THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I PREPARED FOR? I PREPARED TO BE PRESIDENT AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. >> MR. TRUMP, FOR FIVE YEARS, YOU PERPETUATED RESPOND. THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG DENY THAT. BUT JUST LAST WEEK YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID IT WAS TRUE. SO WHEN YOU TRY TO ACT CLINTON TALKS ABOUT THIS, I MEAN, I'LL TAKE THE ADMIRALS AND I'LL TAKE THE GENERALS ANY DAY OVER THE POLITICAL HACKS THAT I SEE THAT HAVE LED OUR COUNTRY SO BRILLIANTLY ADDRESSING. I HAVE PUT FORTH A PLAN TO DEFEAT ISIS. MONEY, FOREIGN WEAPONS. SO WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS THE TOP PRIORITY HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE LOT OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE MY QUESTION WAS -- >> YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT I SAID. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, I KNOW HOW TO WIN. SHE DOES NOT -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON? >> WAIT. THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, IF SHE EVER WINS THIS RACE, THEY WON'T BE TAKEN CARE OF. >> MR.

WHO HAS SAID -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT. >> WHO HAVE SAID WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT NICE. BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS LEAVING. THEY'RE GONE.

DO YOU BELIEVE THAT POLICE ARE IMPLICITLY BIASED AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE? >> LESTER, I THINK IMPLICIT BIAS IS A PROBLEM FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST POLICE. I THINK, UNFORTUNATELY, TOO MANY OF US IN OUR GREAT COUNTRY JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT EACH OTHER, AND, THEREFORE, I THINK WE NEED ALL OF >> MR. TRUMP, FOR FIVE YEARS, YOU PERPETUATED YOU RESPOND TO THAT. THERE'S A LOT THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COUNTRIES AND YOU'RE GOING TO STOP THEM? I DON'T THINK SO. >> MR. TRUMP, WITH A LOT OF THESE ARE >> WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR? I WAS AGAINST -- WAIT A MINUTE. A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE RELEASES THEM, I WILL RELEASE -- I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AND THAT'S AGAINST, MY LAWYERS THEY SAY DON'T DO IT. I WILL TELL YOU THIS. IN FACT, WATCHING SHOWS, READING THE PAPERS, ALMOST EVERY LAWYER SAYS YOU DON'T RELEASE YOUR RETURNS UNTIL THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE. WHEN THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE, I'LL DO IT BUT I WOULD GO AGAINST THEM IF SHE RELEASES HER E-MAILS >> SO IT'S NEGOTIABLE? THAT'S LAW AND ORDER. WE NEED LAW AND ORDER. IF WE DON'T HAVE IT, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY, AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHARLOTTE, A CITY I LOVE, A CITY WHERE I HAVE INVESTMENTS, WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON THROUGHOUT VARIOUS PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY, WHETHER IT'S -- I MEAN, I CAN JUST KEEP VERY -- I MEAN, A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE OUR INNER CITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HAVE THE GREATEST MESS ANYONE'S EVER SEEN. YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST. IT'S A TOTAL MESS. UNDER YOUR DIRECTION TO A LARGE EXTENT, BUT YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU STARTED THE IRAN DEAL. THAT'S ANOTHER BEAUTY WHERE YOU HAVE A COUNTRY THAT WAS READY TO FALL, I MEAN, IT WAS DOING SO BADLY, THEY WERE CHOKING ON FAST. WHEN ISIS FORMED IN THIS VACUUM CREATED BY BARACK OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON, AND BELIEVE ME, YOU WERE THE ONES THAT TOOK OUT THE TROOPS. NOT ONLY THAT, YOU NAMED THE DAY. THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THEY SAT BACK PROBABLY AND SAID -- >> LESTER, WE COVERED THIS -- >> WAIT A MINUTE. THEY SAID WAIT A MINUTE, WHEN THEY FORMED, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING OUT ISIS. BUT YOU WERE THERE AND YOU WERE SECRETARY OF STATE WHEN IT WAS A LITTLE INFANT. I THEN DID AN INTERVIEW WITH NEIL CAVUTO, TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY IS MORE IMPORTANT. I SPOKE TO SEAN HANNITY, EVERYBODY REFUSES TO CALL SEAN HANNITY. I HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH SEAN HANNITY AT FOX AND SEAN HANNITY SAID, AND HE CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY, AND I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT IT. HE SAID, YOU WERE TOTALLY AGAINST THE WAR. HE WAS FOR THE WAR. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT BETTER -- >> THAT WAS BEFORE THE WAR STARTED. SEAN HANNITY SAID, VERY STRONGLY, TO ME AND OTHER PEOPLE, HE'S WILLING TO SAY, BUT NOBODY WANTS TO CALL HIM. I WAS AGAINST THE WAR. HE SAID, YOU USED TO HAVE FIGHTS WITH ME BECAUSE SEAN WAS IN BUT IF SOMEBODY, AND I'LL ASK THE PRESS, IF SOMEBODY WOULD CALL UP SEAN HANNITY, THIS WAS BEFORE THE WAR BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS DURING THE LAST -- SO SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE THAT I AGREE, BUT IT'S BAD, BAD EXPERIENCE. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL THAT YOU'RE SO IN LOVE WITH WHERE WE GAVE THEM $150 BILLION BACK. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL, WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- EXCUSE ANY. I WILL BRING BACK JOBS. YOU CAN'T BRING BACK JOBS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY, I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS QUITE A BIT. >> YEAH, FOR 30 YEARS. >> I HAVE -- WELL, NOT QUITE THAT LONG. I THINK MY HUSBAND DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN THE 1990s. I THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WORKED AND HOW -- >> HE APPROVED NAST  ED NAFTA, SINGLE WORST TRADE DEAL APPROVED IN THE COUNTRY. >> INCOMES WENT UP FOR EVERYBODY. MANUFACTURING JOBS WENT UP ALSO IN THE IT LOOK AT THE FACTS. WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE, I HAD A NUMBER OF TRADE DEALS THAT CAME BEFORE ME AND I YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PRESIDENT BY A MAJOR PARTY. EARLIER THIS MONTH YOU SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE, \"A PRESIDENTIAL LOOK.\" SHE'S STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE STAMINA. TO BE PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY, YOU NEED TREMENDOUS STAMINA. >> THE QUOTE WAS \"I JUST DON'T THINK SHE HAS -- >> WAIT A MINUTE. YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION. DID SHE ASK ME A QUESTION? YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ON TRADE DEALS. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE -- THAT'S RIGHT, WITH JAPAN, WITH SAUDI ARABIA. I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE WE'RE DEFENDING SAUDI ARABIA AND WITH ALL OF THE MONEY THEY HAVE, WE'RE DEFENDING THEM AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. AND THIS COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE. >> WE ARE AT THE -- WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION -- >> WELL, ONE THING -- >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT. >> WHO HAVE SAID WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO AND HAS BECOME A U.S. CITIZEN AND YOU CAN BET SHE'S GOING TO VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. >> OKAY. GOOD. LET ME JUST TELL YOU -- >> MR. TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH CHINA 50%. SO I KNOW HOW TO REALLY WORK TO GET NEW JOBS AND TO GET EXPORTS THAT HELP TO CREATE MORE NEW JOBS. >> VERY QUICKLY -- >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN 30 YEARS OR 26 YEARS. >> I'VE BEEN A SENATOR, DONALD. >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. NA N NAFTA IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL SIGNED ANYWHERE, IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW YOU WANT TO APPROVE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP.

WHY -- >> THE RECORD DOES NOT SHOW -- >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY -- >> THE RECORD SHOWS THAT I'M RIGHT. WHEN I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD STERN, VERY LIKELY FIRST TIME ANYONE'S ASKED ME THAT, I SAID, VERY LIKEL LI NA N NAFTA IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL SIGNED ANYWHERE, IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW YOU WANT TO APPROVE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF IT THEN HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING HOW ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS.

PROHIBITION ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND PERHAPS WE'RE NOT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS.

YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. SAID IT WAS THE FINEST DEAL YOU'VE EVER SEEN. YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID ABOUT IT AND YOU WERE AGAINST IT. >> DONALD, I KNOW YOU LIVE IN YOUR OWN REALITY -- >> OH, YEAH. >> -- THAT IS NOT THE NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. THAT WOULD ADD $5 TRILLION TO THE DEBT. >> BUT YOU HAVE NO PLAN. >> EDUCATE -- OH, I DO. >> SECRETARY, YOU HAVE INCREASES ON THE NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE YOU RESPOND TO THAT.

I DID SAY, I HOPED IT WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL. WHEN IT WAS NEGOTIATED -- INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS SUGGESTED THAT YOU AND ORDER AND WE NEED LAW AND ORDER IN THE INNER CITIES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY WHAT'S HAPPENING ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC PEOPLE.

SO WE HAVE TO GET VERY, VERY TOUGH ON CYBER AND CYBER WARFARE. IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM. I HAVE A SON, HE'S 10 YEARS OLD. HE HAS COMPUTERS. HE IS SO GOOD WITH THESE COMPUTERS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. THE SECURITY ASPECT OF DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY -- >> WRONG. >> -- PROVED OVER AND KNOWS, ESSENTIALLY. I THEN DID AN INTERVIEW WITH NEIL CAVUTO, TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY IS MORE IMPORTANT. ENTER OUR LAST SEGMENT, ON THE SUBJECT OF SECURING NAERK.

ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS, PRESIDENT OBAMA REPORTEDLY CONSIDERED CHANGING THE NATION'S LONGSTANDING POLICY ON FIRST USE. DO YOU SUPPORT THE CURRENT POLICY? MR. TRUMP, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES ON THAT. >> I HAVE TO SAY, FOR WHAT SECRETARY CLINTON WAS SAYING ABOUT NUCLEAR WITH RUSSIA, SHE'S VERY CAVALIER IN THE WAY SHE TALKS ABOUT VARIOUS COUNTRIES BUT RUSSIA HAS BEEN EXPANDING. THEY HAVE A MUCH NEWER CAPABILITY THAN WE DO. WE HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATING FROM THE NEW STANDPOINT. I LOOKED THE OTHER NIGHT, I WAS SEEING B52s, THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH THAT YOUR FATHER, YOUR GRANDFATHER COULD BE FLYING THEM. WE ARE NOT -- WE ARE NOT KEEPING UP WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. I WOULD LIKE EVERYBODY TO END IT, JUST GET RID OF IT, BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT DO FIRST STRIKE. I THINK THAT ONCE THE NUCLEAR ALTERNATIVE HAPPENS, IT'S OVER. WOMAN MISS PIGGY.

NOW, WHETHER OR NOT IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO YOU DO STOP AND FRISK, WHICH WORKED VERY >> YOUR TWO MINUTES HAS EXPIRED. I DO WANT TO FOLLOW-UP. STOP AND FRISK WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN NEW YORK BECAUSE IT LARGELY SINGLED OUT BLACK AND HISPANIC YOUNG MEN. >> NO, YOU'RE WRONG. IT WENT BEFORE A JUDGE WHO WAS A VERY AGAINST POLICE JUDGE. IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM SECOND-CHANCE PROGRAMS. I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE ENDING PRIVATE PRISONS IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. I WANT TO SEE THEM A POLITICAL REASON WHY YOU CAN'T SAY IT, BUT I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE -- IN NEW YORK CITY, STOP AND FRISK, WE HAD 2,200 MURDERS TO 500 AND IT WAS CONTINUED ON BY MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND IT WAS TERMINATED BY CURRENT MAYOR. BUT STOP AND FRISK HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE SAFETY OF NEW YORK CITY, TREMENDOUS BEYOND BELIEF. SO WHEN YOU SAY IT HAS NO IMPACT, IT REALLY DID. IT HAD A VERY, VERY BIG IMPACT. >> WELL, IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY, IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS, THAT UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR, CRIME TOLD THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. YOU RESPOND TO THAT. THERE'S A LOT THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL HEALING IN THIS SEGMENT. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICANS -- >> WELL, I WAS VERY -- COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND I THINK I DID A GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT EVEN FOR THE PRESIDENT IN GETTING HIM TO PRODUCE HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE. BUT REMEMBER, DONALD STARTED HIS CAREER BACK IN 1973 BEING SUED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT RENT APARTMENTS IN ONE OF HIS DEVELOPMENTS TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HE MADE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED FOR HIM UNDERSTOOD THAT WAS THE POLICY. HE ACTUALLY WAS SUED SAY, ISN'T THAT AMAZING, BECAUSE I SETTLED THAT LAWSUIT WITH NO ADMISSION OF SHE'S STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST.

TRUMP -- >> AND LOOK AT HER WEBSITE. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE.

TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE AMERICAN CITIZENS? MR. TRUMP? >> FIRST, I HAVE TO SAY ONE THING. VERY IMPORTANT. SECRETARY CLINTON IS TALKING ABOUT TAKING OUT ISIS. WE WILL TAKE OUT ISIS. WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON CREATED A VACUUM THE WAY THEY GOT OUT OF IRAQ BECAUSE THEY GOT OUT WRONG. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN. ONCE THEY GOT IN, THE WAY THEY GOT OUT WAS A DISASTER AND ISIS WAS FORMED. SHE TALKS ABOUT TAKING THEM OUT. SHE'S BEEN DOING IT A LONG TIME. SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO TAKE THEM OUT FOR A LONG TIME. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN FORMED IF THEY LEFT SOME TROOPS BEHIND LIKE 10,000 OR MAYBE SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT. AND THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THEM. OR AS I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME, AND I THINK YOU'LL AGREE BECAUSE I SAID IT TO YOU ONCE, HAD WE TAKEN THE OIL, AND WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE OIL, ISIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM EITHER BECAUSE THE OIL WAS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF INCOME AND NOW THEY HAVE THE OIL ALL OVER THE PLACE INCLUDING THE OIL, A LOT OF THE OIL IN LIBYA WHICH WAS ANOTHER ONE OF HER DISASTERS. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I HOPE THE FACT CHECKERS ARE TURNING UP THE VOLUME AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS.

SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA. COULD ALSO BE LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. ALSO COULD BE SOMEBODY SITTING ON THEIR BED THAT WEIGHS 400 POUNDS. NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING OUT ISIS. BUT YOU WERE THERE AND YOU WERE SECRETARY OF STATE WHEN IT WAS A LITTLE INFANT. AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO BELIEVE ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET, BUT IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES EVEN A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S GOING TO COME CRASHING DOWN. WE ARE IN A BIG, FAT, UGLY BUBBLE, AND WE DOING POLITICAL BY KEEPING THE INTEREST RATES AT THIS LEVEL, AND BELIEVE ME, THE DAY OBAMA GOES OFF AND HE LEAVES AND GOES OUT TO THE GOLF COURSE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE TO PLAY GOLF, WHEN THEY RAISE INTEREST RATES, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME VERY BAD THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE THE FED IS NOT DOING WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING OUR TRADE DEALS. >> THE IRS SAYS AN WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE >> YOUR TWO MINUTES HAS EXPIRED. I DO WANT TO FOLLOW-UP. STOP AND FRISK WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IMPORTANT TO THE COUNTRY. >> I'LL LET YOU RESPOND. THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION RADICALIZE, EVEN DIRECT PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY AND EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO INTENSIFY OUR WE WILL TAKE OUT ISIS. WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYING AND MY CRITICISM OF NATO. I THINK WE HAVE TO GET NATO TO GO INTO THE MIDDLE EAST WITH US IN COUNTRIES AND YOU'RE GOING TO STOP THEM? I DON'T THINK SO. >> MR. TRUMP, WITH A LOT OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION. WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. >> 2002 -- >> THAT IS A MAINSTREAM MEDIA NONSENSE PUT OUT BY HER BECAUSE SHE THE ECONOMY IS MORE IMPORTANT. I SPOKE TO SEAN HANNITY, EVERYBODY REFUSES TO CALL SEAN HANNITY. I HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH SEAN HANNITY AT FOX AND SEAN HANNITY SAID, AND HE CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY, AND I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT IT. HE SAID, YOU WERE TOTALLY AGAINST THE WAR. HE WAS FOR THE WAR. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT BETTER -- >> THAT WAS BEFORE THE WAR STARTED. SEAN HANNITY SAID, VERY STRONGLY, TO ME AND OTHER PEOPLE, HE'S WILLING TO SAY, BUT NOBODY WANTS TO CALL HIM. I WAS AGAINST THE WAR. HE SAID, YOU USED TO HAVE FIGHTS WITH ME BECAUSE SEAN WAS IN FAVOR OF THE WAR. I UNDERSTAND THAT SIDE ALSO. NOT VERY MUCH, BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE. BUT NOBODY CALLS SEAN HANNITY. THEN THEY DID AN ARTICLE IN A MAJOR MAGAZINE SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR STARTED I THINK IN '04, BUT THEY DID AN ARTICLE WHICH HAD ME TOTALLY AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. AND ONE OF YOUR COMPATRIOTS SAID, YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT WAS BEFORE OR RIGHT AFTER, TRUMP WAS DEFINITE BECAUSE IF YOU READ THIS ARTICLE, THERE'S NO DOUBT. >> THE WORLD -- LET ME TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO.

I HAVE A MUCH BETTER -- SHE SPENT, LET ME TELL YOU, SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ADVERTISING -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET, MAYBE BY FAR, IS MY TEMPERAMENT. I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT. I KNOW HOW TO WIN. SHE DOES NOT -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON? >> WAIT. THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY AND OCTOBER 19th AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS. THE CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE. A REMINDER THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IS SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER UNIVERSITY IN FARMVILLE, VIRGINIA. MY THANKS TO HILLARY CLINTON AND TO DONALD INNER CITIES AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS AND IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL BUT WE HAVE NO LEADERSHIP AND HONESTLY, THAT STARTS WITH SECRETARY CLINTON. >> ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE IS TWO MINUTES OF THE SAME QUESTION TO DEFEND TAX INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, FOR 40 YEARS, EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS. YOU CAN GO AND SEE NEARLY, I THINK, 39, RETURNS, BUT EVERYONE HAS DONE IT. WE KNOW THE IRS HAS MADE CLEAR THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS FINGERS ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUCLEAR CODES AS FAR AS I THINK ANYONE WITH ANY SENSE ABOUT THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNED. >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT. >> WHO HAVE SAID WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE >> MR. TRUMP, FOR FIVE YEARS, YOU PERPETUATED A FALSE CLAIM OF THE NATION'S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT WAS NOT A NATURAL BORN CITIZEN. YOU QUESTIONED HIS LEGITIMACY. THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT MOST AMERICANS HAVE ACCEPTED FOR YEARS, THE PRESIDENT WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? >> I'LL TELL YOU -- WELL, JUST VERY SIMPLE TO SAY. >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST.

WHY NOT. THIS JANET YELLEN OF THE FED, THE FED IS DOING POLITICAL BY KEEPING THE INTEREST RATES AT THIS LEVEL, AND BELIEVE ME, THE DAY OBAMA GOES OFF AND HE LEAVES AND GOES OUT TO THE GOLF COURSE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE TO PLAY GOLF, WHEN THEY RAISE INTEREST RATES, YOU'RE GOING TO THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PAINTS SUCH A DIRE AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PAINTS SUCH A DIRE >> I'D LIKE TO RESPOND. >> PLEASE RESPOND THEN I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. >> LOOK, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LET DOWN BY OUR POLITICIANS.

AND, IN FACT, HIS CAVALIER ATTITUDE ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS SO DEEPLY TROUBLING. THAT IS THE NUMBER-ONE THREAT WE FACE IN THE WORLD AND IT BECOMES PARTICULARLY THREATENING IF TERRORISTS EVER GET THEIR HANDS ON ANY SHE'S STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW.

AND I WANT TO REASSURE OUR ALLIES IN JAPAN, IN SOUTH KOREA, AND ELSEWHERE THAT WE HAVE MUTUAL DEFENSE TREATIES AND WE WILL HONOR THEM. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT AMERICA'S WORD BE GOOD AND SO I KNOW THAT THIS CAMPAIGN HAS CAUSED SOME QUESTIONING AND SOME WORRIES ON THE PART OF MANY LEADERS ACROSS THE GLOBE. I'VE TALKED WITH A NUMBER OF THEM, BUT I WANT TO, ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND I THINK ON BEHALF OF A MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, OUR WORD IS GOOD. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT THE ENTIRE GLOBAL SITUATION. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE HAVE OTHER PROBLEMS WITH IRAN, BUT DEALS. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE -- THAT'S RIGHT, WITH JAPAN, WITH SAUDI ARABIA. I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE WE'RE DEFENDING SAUDI ARABIA AND WITH ALL OF THE MONEY THEY HAVE, WE'RE DEFENDING THEM AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS FRONT OF A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE, HE CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT STAMINA. >> THE WORLD -- LET ME TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS DURING THE LAST -- SO SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE THAT I AGREE, BUT IT'S BAD, BAD EXPERIENCE. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL THAT YOU'RE SO IN LOVE WITH WHERE WE GAVE THEM $150 BILLION BACK. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL, WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. AND THIS COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE. >> WE ARE AT THE -- WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION -- >> WELL, ONE THING -- >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT. >> WHO HAVE SAID WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO AND HAS BECOME A U.S. CITIZEN AND YOU CAN BET SHE'S GOING TO VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. >> OKAY. GOOD. LET ME JUST TELL YOU -- >> MR. TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT NICE. BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE ADS ON ME. MANY OF WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE, THEY'RE UNTRUE AND MISREPRESENTATIONS. I WILL FELL YOU THIS, LESTER. IT'S NOT NICE AND I DON'T -- I DON'T DESERVE THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NICE THING THAT SHE'S DONE. IT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ADS AND THE ONLY GRATIFYING THING IS I SAW THE POLLS COME IN TODAY AND WITH ALL OF THAT MONEY, OVER $200 MILLION IS SPENT AND I'M EITHER WINNING OR TIED. >> ONE OF YOU -- >> I SPENT PRACTICALLY NOTHING. >> ONE OF YOU -- ONE OF YOU WILL NOT WIN THIS ELECTION. SO MY FINAL QUESTION TO YOU TONIGHT, ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT THE OUTCOME AS THE WILL OF THE VOTER? SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I SUPPORT OUR DEMOCRACY, AND SOMETIMES YOU WIN, SOMETIMES YOU LOSE, BUT I CERTAINLY WILL SUPPORT THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. AND I KNOW DONALD'S TRYING VERY HARD TO PLANT DOUBTS ABOUT IT, BUT I HOPE THE PEOPLE OUT THERE UNDERSTAND THIS ELECTION'S REALLY UP TO YOU. IT'S NOT ABOUT US SO MUCH AS IT IS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES AND THE KIND OF COUNTRY AND FUTURE YOU WANT. SO I SURE HOPE YOU WILL GET OUT AND VOTE AS THOUGH YOUR FUTURE DEPENDED ON IT BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES. >> MR. TRUMP, VERY QUICKLY. THE SAME QUESTION. WILL YOU ACCEPT THE OUTCOME AS THE WILL OF THE VOTERS? >> I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE A NATION THAT IS SERIOUSLY TROUBLED. WE'RE LOSING OUR JOBS. PEOPLE ARE POURING IN TO OUR COUNTRY. THE OTHER DAY WE WERE DEPORTING 800 PEOPLE. PERHAPS THEY PRESSED THE WRONG BUTTON. THEY PRESSED THE WRONG BUTTON. OR PERHAPS WORSE THAN THAT, IT WAS CORRUPTION. BUT THESE PEOPLE THAT WE WERE GOING TO DEPORT, FOR GOOD REASON, ENDED UP BECOMING CITIZENS. ENDED UP BECOMING CITIZENS. AND IT WAS 800 AND NOW IT TURNS OUT IT MIGHT BE 1,800 AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW. >> WILL YOU ACCEPT THE OUTCOME OF THE ZPL ELECTION? >> I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. I DON'T BELIEVE HILLARY WILL. THE ANSWER IS IF SHE WINS, I WILL ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT HER. >> ALL RIGHT. THAT IS GOING TO DO IT FOR US. THAT CONCLUDES OUR DEBATE FOR THIS EVENING. A SPIRITED ONE. WE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND. NOT EVERYTHING. AS I SUSPECTED WE WOULDN'T. WOULD. THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES ARE SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 9th IN WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS. AND OCTOBER 19th AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS. THE CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE. A REMINDER THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IS SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER UNIVERSITY IN FARMVILLE, VIRGINIA. THIS MOMENT AS WE WELCOME THE CANDIDATES, DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HILLARY CLINTON. DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. I UNDERSTAND THAT.

YOU KNOW, DONALD WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN HIS LIFE AND THAT'S ALL TO HIS BENEFIT. HE STARTED HIS BUSINESS WITH $14 MILLION, BORROWED FROM HIS FATHER, AND HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT THE MORE YOU HELP BUT THE POLITICIANS HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- EXCUSE ANY. I WILL BRING BACK JOBS. YOU CAN'T BRING BACK JOBS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY, I >> I WILL BRING -- STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. SAID IT WAS THE FINEST DEAL YOU'VE EVER SEEN. SEE. >> WILL NOT ADD A SEE. >> WILL NOT ADD A DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS TOP. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> TYPICAL POLITICIAN. THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. TAX RETURNS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING HE'S YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO.

AND WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SQUANDERED ON SO MANY OF YOUR IDEAS. >> LET YOU RESPOND -- INNER CITIES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY WHAT'S HAPPENING ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC PEOPLE. AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO THEM WHAT OUR POLITICIANS ARE ALLOWING TO HAPPEN. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I'VE HEARD -- I'VE HEARD DONALD SAY THIS AT HIS RALLIES AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PAINTS SUCH A DIRE NEGATIVE PICTURE OF BLACK COMMUNITIES IN OUR COUNTRY. THE VIBRANCY OF THE BLACK CHURCH, THE BLACK BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY SO MANY PEOPLE. THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT SO MANY FAMILIES ARE WORKING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR KIDS. THERE'S A LOT THAT WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF AND WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING AND LIFTING UP, BUT WE DO ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. THERE ARE THE RIGHT WAYS OF DOING IT AND THEN THERE ARE WAYS THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR.

THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG RECORD OF ENGAGING IN RACIST BEHAVIOR. AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE MY QUESTION WAS -- >> YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT I SAID. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS.

THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. I SAID, THERE'S A PERSON WITH A TEMPERAMENT THAT'S GOT A PROBLEM. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WHEW. OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT TWO IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WERE BRIEFLY MENTIONED BY DONALD. FIRST NATO. YOU KNOW, NATO AS A MILITARY ALLIANCE HAS SOMETHING CALLED ARTICLE 5 AND BASICALLY IT SAYS THIS. AN ATTACK ON ONE IS AN ATTACK ON ALL. AND YOU KNOW, THE ONLY TIME IT'S EVER BEEN INVOKED AFTER 9/11 WHEN THE 28 NATIONS OF NATO SAID THAT THEY WOULD GO TO AFGHANISTAN WITH US TO FIGHT TERRORISM. SOMETHING THAT THEY STILL ARE DOING BY OUR SIDE. WITH RESPECT TO IRAN, WHEN I BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE, IRAN WAS WEEKS AWAY FROM HAVING ENOUGH NUCLEAR MATERIAL TO FORM A BOMB. THEY HAD MASTERED THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE UNDER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. THEY HAD BUILT COVERT FACILITIES. THEY HAD STOCKED THEM WITH CENTRIFUGES THAT WERE WHIRLING AWAY. AND WE HAD SANCTIONED THEM. I VOTED FOR EVERY THIS MOMENT AS WE WELCOME THE CANDIDATES, DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HILLARY CLINTON. TO DO, BUT PERHAPS WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT LATER. BUT WE HAVE TO STOP OUR JOBS FROM BEING STOLEN FROM US. WE HAVE TO STOP OUR COMPANIES FROM LEAVING THE UNITED STATES AND WITH IT, FIRING ALL OF THE PEOPLE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT CARRIER AIR-CONDITIONING IN INDIANAPOLIS. THEY FIRED 1,400 PEOPLE. THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO. SO MANY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES ARE DOING THIS. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG BUSINESSES. THAT'S GOING TO BE A JOB CREATOR LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE RONALD REAGAN. IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH. COMPANIES WILL COME. THEY WILL BUILD. THEY WILL EXPAND. NEW COMPANIES WILL START. AND I LOOK VERY, VERY MUCH FORWARD TO DOING IT. WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUR TRADE DEALS AND WE HAVE TO STOP THESE COUNTRIES FROM STEALING OUR COMPANIES AND OUR JOBS. >> SECRETARY CLINTON, WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND? >> WELL, I THINK THAT TRADE IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. OF COURSE, WE HAVE 5% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION. WE HAVE TO TRADE WITH THE OTHER 95%. AND WE NEED TO HAVE SMART, FAIR TRADE DEALS. WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. SAID IT WAS THE FINEST THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. IT'S A FORM OF RACIAL INNER CITIES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY WHAT'S HAPPENING ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC PEOPLE. AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO THEM WHAT OUR POLITICIANS ARE ALLOWING TO HAPPEN. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I'VE HEARD -- I'VE HEARD DONALD SAY THIS AT HIS RALLIES AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PAINTS SUCH A DIRE NEGATIVE PICTURE OF BLACK COMMUNITIES IN OUR COUNTRY.

THERE'S A LOT THAT WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF AND WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING AND LIFTING UP, BUT WE DO ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. THERE ARE THE RIGHT WAYS OF DOING IT AND THEN THERE ARE WAYS THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. SECRETARY OF STATE INCLUDING, OF COURSE, TAKING OUT BIN LADEN. I THINK WE NEED TO GO AFTER BAGHDADI AS WELL. MAKE THAT ONE OF OUR ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO DEFEAT ISIS AND GOT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DISRUPT THEIR PROPAGANDA EFFORTS ONLINE. >> YOU MENTIONED ISIS AND WE THINK OF ISIS CERTAINLY AS OVER THERE, BUT THERE ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO HAVE BEEN INSPIRED TO COMMIT ACTS OF TERROR ON AMERICAN SOIL. THE LATEST INCIDENT, OF COURSE, THE BOMBINGS WE JUST SAW IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY. THE KNIFE ATTACK AT A MALL IN MINNESOTA. AND THE LAST YEAR, DEADLY ATTACKS IN SAN BERNARDINO AND ORLANDO. I'LL ASK THIS TO BOTH OF YOU. TELL US SPECIFICALLY HOW YOU WOULD PREVENT HOMEGROWN ATTACKS BY AMERICAN CITIZENS? MR. TRUMP? >> FIRST, I HAVE TO SAY ONE THING. VERY IMPORTANT. SECRETARY CLINTON IS TALKING ABOUT TAKING OUT ISIS. WE WILL TAKE OUT ISIS. WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON CREATED A VACUUM THE WAY THEY GOT OUT OF IRAQ BECAUSE THEY GOT OUT WRONG. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN. ONCE THEY GOT IN, THE WAY THEY GOT OUT WAS A DISASTER AND ISIS WAS FORMED. SHE TALKS ABOUT TAKING THEM OUT. SHE'S BEEN DOING IT A LONG TIME. SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO TAKE THEM OUT FOR A LONG TIME. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN FORMED IF THEY LEFT SOME TROOPS BEHIND LIKE 10,000 OR MAYBE SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT. AND THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THEM. OR AS I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME, AND I THINK YOU'LL AGREE BECAUSE I SAID IT TO YOU ONCE, HAD WE TAKEN THE OIL, AND WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE OIL, ISIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM EITHER BECAUSE THE OIL WAS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF INCOME AND NOW THEY HAVE THE OIL ALL OVER THE PLACE INCLUDING THE OIL, A LOT OF THE OIL IN LIBYA WHICH WAS ANOTHER ONE OF HER DISASTERS. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I HOPE THE FACT CHECKERS ARE TURNING UP THE VOLUME AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE.

I THINK WE HAVE TO GET NATO TO GO INTO THE MIDDLE EAST WITH US IN ADDITION TO SURROU SURROUNDING NATIONS AND WE HAVE TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS AND WE HAVE TO DO IT FAST. WHEN ISIS FORMED IN THIS VACUUM CREATED BY BARACK OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON, AND BELIEVE ME, YOU WERE THE ONES THAT TOOK OUT THE TROOPS. NOT ONLY THAT, YOU NAMED THE DAY. THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

DO YOU BELIEVE THAT POLICE ARE IMPLICITLY BIASED AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE? >> LESTER, I THINK IMPLICIT BIAS IS A PROBLEM FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST POLICE. I THINK, UNFORTUNATELY, TOO THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT GOT HIM TO PRODUCE THE TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG RECORD OF ENGAGING IN RACIST BEHAVIOR. YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID IT WAS TRUE. SO WHEN YOU TRY TO ACT >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, I HOPE THE FACT CHECKERS ARE TURNING UP THE VOLUME AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. INVASION.

I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET, MAYBE BY FAR, >> -- I HEARD DONALD SAY HAS BEEN ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT HE DIDN'T CARE IF NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SO A MAN WHO CAN BE PROVOKED BY A TWEET SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS FINGERS ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUCLEAR CODES AS FAR AS I THINK ANYONE WITH ANY SENSE ABOUT THIS SHOULD BE CONCERNED. RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. AND THIS COUNTRY CAN'T SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT. >> WHO HAVE SAID WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO SAYING THAT THIS HAPPENED. BLUMENTHAL SENT McCLATCHY, HIGHLY RESPECTED REPORTER, TO KENYA TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT. THEY WERE PRESSING IT VERY HARD. SHE FAILED TO GET THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. WHEN I GOT INVOLVED, I DIDN'T FAIL. I GOT HIM TO GIVE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. SO I'M SATISFIED WITH IT. I'LL TELL YOU WHY I'M SATISFIED WITH IT BECAUSE I WANT TO GET ON TO DEFEATING ISIS. I WANT TO GET ON TO CREATING JOBS. I WANT TO GET ON TO HAVING A STRONG BORDER. BECAUSE I WANT TO GET ON TO THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COUNTRY. >> I'LL LET YOU RESPOND. THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, BY HAVING THE WEALTHY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE AND CLOSE THE CORPORATE LOOPHOLES. DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN NATION. AND WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT NEEDS NEW ROADS, NEW TUNNELS, NEW BRIDGES, NEW AIRPORTS, NEW SCHOOLS, NEW HOSPITALS. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SQUANDERED ON SO MANY OF YOUR IDEAS. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS DURING THE DON'T EVEN KNOW. >> WILL YOU ACCEPT THE OUTCOME OF THE ZPL ELECTION? >> I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND CLOSE THE CORPORATE LOOPHOLES. FINALLY WE TONIGHT ARE ON THE STAGE TOGETHER, DONALD TRUMP AND I. DONALD, IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEBATE WHERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY. YOU HAVE TO JUDGE US. BUT THE POLITICIANS HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, FIGHTING -- NO WONDER YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING ISIS YOUR ENTIRE ADULT LIFE. THE WEALTHY. SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU'RE CALLING FOR A TAX INCREASE ON THE INNER CITIES AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS AND IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL BUT WE HAVE NO LEADERSHIP AND HONESTLY, THAT STARTS WITH SECRETARY CLINTON. >> ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE IS TWO MINUTES OF THE SAME QUESTION TO DEFEND TAX INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS CENTURY.

SHE'S TELLING US HOW NEGOTIABLE, NO, LET HER RELEASE -- WHY DID HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID HER. >> ALL RIGHT. THAT IS GOING TO DO IT PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD.

THEY FIRED 1,400 PEOPLE. THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO. SO MANY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES ARE DOING THIS. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, CAN GROW THE ECONOMY. TAKE CLEAN ENERGY. SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21st CENTURY.

SO MANY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES ARE DOING THIS. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN. UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG BUSINESSES. THAT'S GOING TO BE A JOB CREATOR LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE RONALD REAGAN. IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH. COMPANIES WILL COME. THEY WILL BUILD. THEY WILL EXPAND. NEW COMPANIES WILL START. AND I LOOK VERY, VERY MUCH FORWARD TO DOING IT. WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUR TRADE DEALS AND WE HAVE TO STOP THESE COUNTRIES FROM STEALING OUR COMPANIES AND OUR JOBS. >> SECRETARY CLINTON, WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND? >> WELL, I THINK THAT TRADE IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. OF COURSE, WE HAVE 5% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION. WE HAVE TO TRADE WITH THE OTHER 95%. AND WE NEED TO HAVE SMART, FAIR TRADE DEALS. WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS FOR THE TOP PERCENTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAN WE'VE EVER HAD. I CALL IT TRUMPED UP TRICKLE DOWN BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT WOULD BE. THAT IS NOT HOW WE GROW THE ECONOMY. WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR GROWING THE ECONOMY. HOW WE MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL ACTUALLY PRODUCE JOBS AND RISING INCOMES. I THINK WE COME AT IT FROM SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW, DONALD WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN HIS LIFE AND THAT'S ALL TO HIS BENEFIT. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER.

HOW WE MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL ACTUALLY PRODUCE JOBS AND RISING INCOMES. I THINK WE COME AT IT FROM SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW, DONALD WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN HIS LIFE AND THAT'S ALL TO HIS BENEFIT. HE STARTED HIS BUSINESS WITH $14 MILLION, BORROWED FROM HIS FATHER, AND HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT THE MORE YOU HELP THING, AND BEFORE WE START ON THAT, MY FATHER GAVE ME A VERY SMALL LOAN IN 1975 AND I BUILT IT INTO A COMPANY THAT'S WORTH MANY, MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH SOME OF CREATE MORE NEW JOBS. >> VERY QUICKLY -- >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN 30 YEARS OR 26 YEARS. THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. SAID IT WAS THE FINEST DEAL YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

I THINK MY STRONGEST OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS FRONT OF A ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. AND THIS COUNTRY CAN'T BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- YOU -- >> MR. TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG WOULD BE. THAT IS NOT HOW WE GROW THE ECONOMY. WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR GROWING THE ECONOMY. HOW WE MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL ACTUALLY PRODUCE JOBS AND RISING INCOMES. I THINK WE COME AT IT FROM SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW, DONALD WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN HIS LIFE AND THAT'S ALL TO HIS BENEFIT. HE STARTED HIS BUSINESS WITH $14 MILLION, BORROWED FROM HIS FATHER, AND HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT THE MORE YOU HELP WEALTHY PEOPLE, THE BETTER OFF WE'LL BE AND THAT EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT FROM THERE. I DON'T BUY THAT. I HAVE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. MY FATHER WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. HE WORKED REALLY HARD. HE PRINTED DRAPERY FABRICS ON LONG TABLES WHERE HE PULLED OUT THOSE FABRICS AND HE WENT DOWN WITH A SILK SCREEN AND DUMPED THE PAINT IN AND TOOK THE SQUEEGEE AND KEPT GOING. WHAT I BELIEVE, THE MORE WE CAN DO FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE MORE WE CAN INVEST IN YOU, YOUR EDUCATION, YOUR SKILLS, YOUR FUTURE, THE BETTER WE WILL BE OFF AND THE BETTER WE'LL GROW. THAT'S THE KIND OF ECONOMY I WANT US TO SEE AGAIN. >> LET ME FOLLOW-UP WITH MR. TRUMP IF I CAN. YOU TALKED ABOUT CREATING 25 MILLION JOBS AND PROMISED TO BRING BACK MILLIONS OF JOBS FOR AMERICANS. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BRING BACK THE INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE LEFT THIS COUNTRY FOR CHEAPER LABOR OVERSEAS? HOW SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU GOING TO TELL AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS THAT YOU HAVE TO COME BACK? >> WELL, FOR ONE THING, AND BEFORE WE START ON THAT, MY FATHER GAVE ME A VERY SMALL LOAN IN 1975 AND I BUILT IT INTO A COMPANY THAT'S WORTH MANY, MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH SOME OF CREATE MORE NEW JOBS. >> VERY QUICKLY -- >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN 30 YEARS OR 26 YEARS. YOU KNOW IF YOU DID WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T PAY ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. >> THAT MAKES ME SMART. >> IF HE'S PAID ZERO, THAT MEANS ZERO FOR I HAVE A GREAT COMPANY. I HAVE A TREMENDOUS INCOME. THE REASON I SAY THAT IS NOT IN A BRIDGES, NEW AIRPORTS, NEW SCHOOLS, NEW HOSPITALS. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SQUANDERED ON SO MANY OF YOUR IDEAS. >> LET YOU RESPOND -- >> YOUR TWO MINUTES HAS EXPIRED. I DO WANT TO FOLLOW-UP. STOP AND FRISK WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN NEW YORK BECAUSE IT LARGELY SINGLED OUT BLACK AND HISPANIC YOUNG MEN. >> NO, YOU'RE WRONG. IT WENT BEFORE A JUDGE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST SHE'S STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS.

I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. I SAID, THERE'S A OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- YOU -- >> MR. TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE UNDER MY PLAN, I'LL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, >> I WILL BRING -- EXCUSE ANY. I WILL BRING BACK JOBS. YOU CAN'T BRING BACK JOBS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY, I WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE OUR INNER CITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PAINTS SUCH A DIRE NEGATIVE PICTURE OF BLACK COMMUNITIES IN OUR COUNTRY. THE VIBRANCY OF THE IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST TREMENDOUSLY FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG BUSINESSES. NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT HE PAINTS SUCH A DIRE NEGATIVE PICTURE OF BLACK COMMUNITIES IN OUR COUNTRY. THE VIBRANCY OF THE AND I WILL TELL YOU, YOU LOOK AT THE INNER CITIES AND I JUST LEFT DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND I JUST -- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE SEEN ME. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU DECIDED TO STAY HOME AND THAT'S OKAY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER AND I'VE MET SOME OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE I'LL EVER MEET WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY UPSET WITH WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE TOLD THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST MY QUESTION WAS -- >> YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT I SAID. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I ALSO HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE HAS. YOU KNOW? I HAVE A MUCH BETTER -- SHE SPENT, LET ME TELL YOU, SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ADVERTISING -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET, MAYBE BY FAR, IS MY TEMPERAMENT. I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT. I KNOW HOW TO WIN. SHE DOES NOT -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON? >> WAIT. THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY THEIR HANDS ON ANY NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SO A MAN WHO CAN BE PROVOKED BY A TWEET SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS FINGERS ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUCLEAR CODES AS BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID AND I LOOK VERY, VERY MUCH FORWARD TO DOING IT. WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUR TRADE DEALS AND WE HAVE TO STOP THESE COUNTRIES FROM STEALING OUR COMPANIES AND OUR JOBS. >> SECRETARY CLINTON, WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND? >> WELL, I THINK THAT TRADE IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. OF COURSE, WE HAVE 5% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION. WE HAVE TO TRADE WITH THE OTHER 95%. AND WE NEED TO HAVE SMART, FAIR TRADE DEALS. WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHAT THE REAL REASONS ARE BECAUSE IT MUST BE WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUR TRADE DEALS AND WE BUSINESS WITH $14 MILLION, BORROWED FROM HIS FATHER, AND HE >> COULD I JUST FINISH THAT? I THINK I SHOULD. YOU GO TO HER WEBSITE AND TAKE A LOOK AT HER WEBSITE, SHE'S GOING TO RAISE TAXES $1.3 TRILLION. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> AND LOOK AT HER WEBSITE. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS I GET AUDITED BY THE IRS. OTHER PEOPLE DON'T. I WILL SAY THIS. WE HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE YOU TO BE SILENT. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US. SECRETARY CLINTON? >> I THINK YOU'VE SEEN ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF BAIT AND SWITCH HERE. FOR 40 YEARS, EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS. YOU CAN GO AND SEE NEARLY, I THINK, 39, RETURNS, BUT EVERYONE HAS DONE IT. WE KNOW THE IRS HAS MADE CLEAR THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE WE'RE A SERIOUS DEBTOR NATION. AND WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT NEEDS NEW ROADS, NEW TUNNELS, NEW BRIDGES, NEW AIRPORTS, NEW SCHOOLS, NEW HOSPITALS. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SQUANDERED ON SO MANY OF YOUR IDEAS. >> LET YOU RESPOND -- DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND I JUST -- YOU KNOW, THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG RECORD OF ENGAGING IN RACIST BEHAVIOR. YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID IT WAS TRUE. SO WHEN YOU TRY TO ACT HOW MUCH WILL WE DO? THAT'S WHY I WAS SO SHOCKED WHEN DONALD PUBLICLY INVITED PUTIN THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND PERHAPS WE'RE NOT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA.

I SAID, THERE'S A PERSON WITH A TEMPERAMENT THAT'S GOT NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN ABOUT IT. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, BECAUSE OF TAX POLICIES THAT SLASHED TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, FAILED TO INVEST IN THE MIDDLE CLASS, TOOK THEIR EYES OFF OF WALL STREET, AND CREATED A PERFECT STORM. IN FACT, DONALD WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS. HE SAID BACK IN 2006, GEE, I HOPE IT DOES COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEN I CAN GO IN AND BUY SOME AND MAKE SOME MONEY. WELL, IT DID COLLAPSE. >> THAT'S CALLED BUSINESS, BY THE WAY. >> 9 MILLION PEOPLE, 9 MILLION PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS. THEIR HOMES AND $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH WAS WIPED OUT. NOW, WE HAVE COME BACK FROM THAT ABYSS AND IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY. SO WE'RE NOW ON THE PRECIPICE OF HAVING A POTENTIALLY MUCH BETTER ECONOMY, BUT THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO IS TO GO BACK TO THE POLICIES THAT FAILED US IN THE FIRST PLACE. INDEPENDENT EXPERTS HAVE LOOKED AT WHAT I'VE PROPOSED AND LOOKED AT WHAT DONALD'S PROPOSED AND BASICALLY THEY'VE SAID THIS. THAT IF HIS TAX PLAN, WHICH WOULD BLOW UP THE DEBT BY OVER $5 TRILLION AND WOULD, IN SOME INSTANCES, DISADVANTAGE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES COMPARED TO THE WEALTHY, WERE TO GO INTO EFFECT, WE WOULD LOSE 3.5 MILLION JOBS. AND MAYBE HAVE ANOTHER RECESSION. THEY'VE LOOKED AT MY PLANS AND THEY'VE SAID, OKAY, IF WE CAN DO THIS, AND I INTEND TO GET IT DONE, WE WILL HAVE 10 MILLION MORE NEW JOBS BECAUSE WE WILL BE MAKING INVESTMENTS WHERE WE CAN GROW THE ECONOMY. TAKE CLEAN ENERGY. SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21st CENTURY. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAXE PERPETRATED BY THE CHINESE. I THINK IT'S REAL.

WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE HELP FAMILIES BALANCE THE RESPONSIBILITIES AT HOME AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES AT BUSINESS. SO WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST SET OF PLANS. AND PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT BOTH OF OUR PLANS, HAVE CONCLUDED THAT MINE WOULD CREATE 10 MILLION JOBS AND YOURS WOULD LOSE US 3.5 MILLION JOBS AND EXPLODE THE DEBT -- >> YOU ARE GOING TO APPROVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN HISTORY. YOU'RE GOING TO APPROVE WHONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX INCREASES IN HISTORY. YOU ARE GOING TO DRIVE BUSINESS OUT. YOUR REGULATIONS ARE A DISASTER. YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE REGULATIONS ALL OVER THE PLACE. BY THE WAY, MY TAX CUT IS THE BIGGEST SINCE RONALD REAGAN. I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. IT WILL CREATE TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF NEW JOBS, BUT REGULATIONS, YOU ARE GOING TO REGULATE THESE BUSINESSES OUT OF EXISTENCE. WHEN I GO AROUND, LESTER, I TELL YOU THIS, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER, AND WHEN I GO AROUND, DESPITE THE TAX CUT, THE THINGS THAT BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE LIKE THE MOST IS THE FACT THAT I'M CUTTING REGULATION. YOU HAVE REGULATIONS ON TOP OF REGULATIONS, AND NEW COMPANIES CANNOT FORM AND OLD COMPANIES ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS AND YOU WANT TO INCREASE THE REGULATIONS AND MAKE THEM EVEN WORSE. I'M GOING TO CUT REGULATIONS. I'M GOING TO CUT TAXES BIG LEAGUE AND YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE TAXES BIG LEAGUE. END OF STORY. >> LET ME GET YOU TO PAUSE RIGHT THERE. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT SEGMENT. WE'RE GOING TO TALK -- >> THAT CAN'T BE LEFT -- >> PLEASE, TAKE 30 SECONDS. >> I KIND OF ASSUMED THAT THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF THESE CHARGES AND CLAIMS AND SO -- >> FACTS. >> -- WE HAVE TAKEN THE HOME PAGE OF MY WEBSITE, HILLARYCLINTON.COM AND TOP. >> MR.

STOP AND FRISK WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN NEW YORK BECAUSE IT GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS, THAT UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR, CRIME HAS CONTINUED TO DROP THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD AND HERE'S WHAT WE CAN DO. WE CAN DEPLOY A HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS. WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME. WE CAN BUILD A NEW THEY LOST PLENTY OF MONEY ON THAT ONE. NOW, LOOK, I'M A GREAT BELIEVER IN ALL FORMS SEMI-EXACT. SO I WILL TELL YOU THIS. WE HAVE TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB AT KEEPING OUR JOBS AND WE HAVE TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB AT GIVING COMPANIES INCENTIVE TO BUILD NEW COMPANIES OR TO EXPAND BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DOING IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT MICHIGAN, LOOK AT OHIO AND LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PLACES WHERE SO MANY OF THEIR JOBS AND THEIR COMPANIES ARE JUST LEAVING. THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- EXCUSE ANY. I WILL BRING BACK JOBS. YOU CAN'T BRING BACK JOBS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY, I >> TYPICAL POLITICIAN. ALL TALK, NO ACTION. SOUNDS GOOD, DOESN'T WORK. NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. OUR COUNTRY IS RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET, YOU GET SHOT. IN CHICAGO, THEY'VE HAD THOUSANDS OF SHOOTINGS, THOUSANDS SINCE JANUARY 1st. THOUSANDS OF SHOOTINGS. I SAY, WHERE IS THIS? IS THIS A WAR-TORN COUNTRY? WHAT ARE WE DOING? RIGHT, WITH JAPAN, WITH SAUDI ARABIA. I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE WE'RE DEFENDING SAUDI ARABIA AND WITH ALL OF THE MONEY THEY HAVE, WE'RE DEFENDING THEM AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE RELEASES THEM, I WILL RELEASE -- I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AND THAT'S AGAINST, MY LAWYERS THEY SAY DON'T DO IT. I WILL TELL YOU THIS. IN FACT, WATCHING SHOWS, READING THE PAPERS, ALMOST EVERY LAWYER SAYS YOU DON'T RELEASE YOUR RETURNS UNTIL THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE. WHEN THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE, I'LL DO IT BUT I WOULD GO AGAINST THEM IF SHE RELEASES HER E-MAILS >> SO IT'S NEGOTIABLE? >> IT'S NOT NEGOTIABLE, NO, LET HER RELEASE -- WHY DID SHE DELETE 33,000 -- >> I'LL LET HER ANSWER THAT. LET ME ADMONISH THE AUDIENCE ONE MORE TIME. THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT, WE ASKED YOU TO BE SILENT. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US. SECRETARY CLINTON? >> I THINK YOU'VE SEEN ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF BAIT AND SWITCH HERE. FOR 40 YEARS, EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS. YOU CAN GO AND SEE NEARLY, I THINK, 39, RETURNS, BUT EVERYONE HAS DONE IT. WE KNOW THE IRS HAS MADE CLEAR THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T PAY ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. >> THAT MAKES ME DEATH OF YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN. MORE THAN THE NEXT NINE CAUSES PUT TOGETHER. SO WE HAVE TO DO TWO THINGS AS I SAID. WE HAVE TO RESTORE TRUST. WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE POLICE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY RESPECT THE COMMUNITIES AND THE COMMUNITIES RESPECT THEM. AND WE HAVE TO TACKLE THE PLAGUE OF GUN VIOLENCE WHICH IS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. >> ALL RIGHT, MR. TRUMP, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE? >> FIRST OF ALL, SECRETARY CLINTON DOESN'T WANT TO USE A COUPLE OF WORDS AND THEIR HANDS ON ANY NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SO A MAN WHO CAN BE AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T IT REPEALED. IF YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE MANY PLACES -- >> THE ARGUMENT IS THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. RACIST BEHAVIOR. AND THE BIRTHER LIE WAS A VERY HURTFUL RESPOND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. I SAID, THERE'S A PERSON WITH A TEMPERAMENT THAT'S GOT RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 BUILD NEW COMPANIES OR TO EXPAND BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DOING IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT MICHIGAN, LOOK AT OHIO AND LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PLACES WHERE SO MANY OF THEIR THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND THEY SHOWED HE DIDN'T PAY ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. >> THAT MAKES ME SMART. >> IF HE'S PAID ZERO, THAT MEANS ZERO FOR DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND I JUST -- YOU KNOW, THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. AND YES, I DID. COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND I THINK I DID A GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT EVEN FOR THE PRESIDENT IN GETTING HIM TO PRODUCE HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE. RACIST BIRTHER LIE TO BED. IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST SHE'S STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE STAMINA. TO BE PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY, YOU NEED >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST. HE LOVES BEAUTY CONTESTS, SUPPORTING THEM AND HANGING AROUND THEM. AND HE CALLED THIS WOMAN MISS PIGGY. THEN HE CALLED HER MISS HOUSEKEEPING BECAUSE SHE WAS LATINA. DONALD, SHE HAS A NAME. >> WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? >> HER NAME IS MACHADO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT MICHIGAN, LOOK AT OHIO AND LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PLACES WHERE SO MANY OF THEIR JOBS AND THEIR COMPANIES ARE JUST LEAVING. THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- >> I WILL BRING -- >> VERY QUICKLY -- >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN 30 YEARS OR 26 YEARS. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. YOU KACALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS. SAID IT WAS THE FINEST I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU PAY ANY FEDERAL INCOME TAX. >> THAT MAKES ME SMART. >> IF HE'S PAID ZERO, THAT MEANS ZERO FOR >> I DO.

I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU DECIDED TO STAY HOME AND THAT'S OKAY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER AND I'VE MET SOME OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE I'LL EVER MEET WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES.

AS SOON AS SHE YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. I COULD DO THAT VERY QUICKLY. I'M VERY UNDERLEVERAGED. I HAVE A GREAT COMPANY. I HAVE A TREMENDOUS INCOME. THE REASON I SAY THAT IS NOT IN A THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE MANY PLACES -- >> THE ARGUMENT IS IT'S A FORM OF RACIAL SHOOTINGS IN CHICAGO FROM JANUARY 1st, WHEN YOU HAVE 4,000 PEOPLE KILLED IN CHICAGO BY GUNS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESIDENCY OF BARACK AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA, FOUGHT VERY HARD, AND YOU CAN GO LOOK IT UP AND YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT AND IF YOU LOOK AT CNN THIS PAST WEEK, PATTI DOYLE IT.

WHEN I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD STERN, VERY LIKELY BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO ARE POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING OUR TRADE DEALS. >> THE IRS SAYS AN AUDIT OF YOUR TAXES -- YOU'RE PERFECTLY FREE TO RELEASE YOUR TAXES DURING AN AUDIT. SO THE QUESTION, DOES THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW OUTWEIGH YOUR PERSONAL -- >> WELL, I TOLD YOU, I WILL RELEASE THEM AS SOON AS THE AUDIT -- LOOK, I'VE BEEN UNDER AUDIT ALMOST FOR 15 YEARS. I KNOW A LOT OF WEALTHY PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN AUDITED. I SAID, DO YOU GET AUDITED? I GET AUDITED ALMOST EVERY YEAR. AND IN A WAY, I SHOULD BE COMPLAINING. I'M NOT EVEN COMPLAINING. I DON'T MIND IT. IT'S ALMOST BECOME A WAY OF LIFE. I GET AUDITED BY THE IRS. OTHER PEOPLE DON'T. I WILL SAY THIS. WE HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE RELEASES THEM, I WILL RELEASE -- I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AND THAT'S AGAINST, MY LAWYERS THEY SAY DON'T RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF BAIT AND SWITCH HERE. FOR 40 YEARS, EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS. YOU CAN GO AND SEE NEARLY, I THINK, 39, RETURNS, BUT EVERYONE HAS DONE IT. WE KNOW THE IRS HAS MADE CLEAR THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM HIDING. ANDGUESSING AT WHAT IT MIGHT BE THAT HE'S HIDING BUT I THINK THE QUESTION IS WERE HE EVER TO GET NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT WOULD BE THOSE CONFLICTS? WHO DOES HE OWE MONEY TO? WELL, HE OWES YOU THE ANSWERS TO THAT. AND HE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM. >> HE ALSO -- HE ALSO RAISED THE ISSUE OF YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER TAKING THE 5th, I >> PLEASE RESPOND THEN I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. >> LOOK, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LET DOWN BY OUR POLITICIANS. THEY TALK GOOD AROUND ELECTION TIME LIKE RIGHT NOW, AND AFTER THE ELECTION, THEY SAY, SEE YOU LATER, I'LL SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY -- LOOK, THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE INNER CITIES HAS BEEN SO BADLY TREATED. THEY'VE BEEN ABUSED AND USED IN ORDER TO GET VOTES BY DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS. THEY CONTROL THESE COMMUNITIES FOR UP TO >> MR. TRUMP -- >> UNBROKEN. AND I WILL TELL YOU, YOU LOOK AT THE INNER CITIES AND I JUST LEFT DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND I JUST -- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE SEEN ME. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU DECIDED TO STAY HOME AND THAT'S OKAY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER AND I'VE MET SOME OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE I'LL EVER MEET WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY UPSET WITH WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE TOLD THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT GOT HIM TO PRODUCE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND I THINK I DID A GOOD JOB. SECRETARY CLINTON ALSO FOUGHT IT, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IN THE MAINSTREAM IS GOING TO SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE. SYDNEY BLUMENTHAL SENT THE REPORTER -- TAKE A LOOK AT CNN LAST WEEK, COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND I THINK I DID A GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT EVEN FOR THE PRESIDENT IN GETTING HIM TO PRODUCE HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HEARD. AND CLEARLY AS DONALD JUST ADMITTED, HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO STAND ON THIS DEBATE STAGE AND LESTER HOLT WAS GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE RACIST BIRTHER LIE TO BED. IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT WAS NOT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR IT, BUT HE PERSISTED. HE PERSISTED YEAR AFTER YEAR BECAUSE SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS, PEOPLE THAT HE WAS TRYING TO TO BRING HIM DOWN. >> MR. TRUMP, YOU CAN RESPOND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE NEXT SEGMENT. >> I WOULD LOVE TO RESPOND. FIRST OF ALL I GOT TO WATCH IN PREPARING FOR THIS SOME OF YOUR DEBATE AGAINST BARACK OBAMA. YOU TREATED HIM WITH TERRIBLE DISRESPECT AND I WATCHED THE WAY YOU TALK NOW ABOUT HOW LOVELY EVERYTHING IS AND HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE. DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. YOU WERE AFTER HIM. YOU WERE TRYING TO -- YOU EVEN SENT OUT, YOUR CAMPAIGN SENT OUT PICTURES OF HIM IN A CERTAIN GARB. VERY FAMOUS PICTURES. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DENY THAT. BUT JUST LAST WEEK YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER TERRIBLE DISRESPECT AND I WATCHED THE WAY YOU TALK NOW ABOUT HOW LOVELY EVERYTHING IS AND HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE. DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. YOU WERE AFTER HIM. YOU WERE TRYING TO -- YOU EVEN SENT OUT, YOUR CAMPAIGN SENT OUT PICTURES OF HIM IN A CERTAIN GARB. VERY FAMOUS PICTURES. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DENY THAT. BUT JUST LAST WEEK THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I ALSO HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE HAS. YOU KNOW? I HAVE A MUCH BETTER -- SHE SPENT, LET ME TELL YOU, SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ADVERTISING -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET, MAYBE BY FAR, IS MY TEMPERAMENT. I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT. I KNOW HOW TO WIN. SHE DOES NOT -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON? >> WAIT. THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, NUCLEAR MATERIAL. SO A MAN WHO CAN BE IF SHE EVER WINS THIS RACE, THEY WON'T BE TAKEN CARE OF. >> MR. TRUMP, THIS YEAR SECRETARY CLINTON BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT BY A MAJOR PARTY. EARLIER THIS MONTH YOU SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE, \"A PRESIDENTIAL LOOK.\" SHE'S STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE STAMINA. TO BE PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY, YOU NEED TREMENDOUS STAMINA. >> THE QUOTE WAS \"I JUST DON'T THINK SHE HAS -- >> WAIT A MINUTE. YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION. DID SHE ASK ME A QUESTION? YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ON TRADE DEALS. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE -- THAT'S RIGHT, WITH JAPAN, WITH SAUDI ARABIA. I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE WE'RE DEFENDING SAUDI ARABIA AND WITH ALL OF THE MONEY THEY HAVE, WE'RE DEFENDING THEM AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS FRONT OF A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE, HE CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT STAMINA. >> THE WORLD -- LET ME TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS DURING THE LAST -- SO SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE THAT I AGREE, BUT IT'S BAD, BAD EXPERIENCE. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL THAT YOU'RE SO IN LOVE WITH WHERE WE GAVE THEM $150 BILLION BACK. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL, WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. AND THIS COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE. >> WE ARE AT THE -- WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION -- >> WELL, ONE THING -- >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. >> OKAY. GOOD. LET ME JUST TELL YOU -- >> MR. TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT NICE. BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE ADS ON ME. MANY OF WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE, THEY'RE UNTRUE AND MISREPRESENTATIONS. I WILL FELL YOU THIS, LESTER. IT'S NOT NICE AND I DON'T -- I DON'T DESERVE THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NICE THING THAT SHE'S DONE.

YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. >> ALL RIGHT, MR. TRUMP, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE? >> FIRST OF ALL, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID TO RAISE TAXES $1.3 TRILLION. >> MR.

YOU KNOW, BARACK OBAMA IS A MAN OF GREAT DIGNITY AND I COULD TELL HOW MUCH IT BOTHERED HIM AND ANNOYED HIM THAT THIS WAS BEING TOUTED AND USED AGAINST HIM, BUT I LIKE TO REMEMBER WHAT MICHELLE OBAMA SAID IN HER AMAZING SPEECH AT OUR DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL HOW MUCH WILL WE DO?

YOU NEED BETTER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES AND THE POLICE BECAUSE IN SOME CASES IT'S NOT GOOD. BUT YOU LOOK AT DALLAS, WHERE THE RELATIONSHIPS WERE REALLY STUDIED.

THE VIBRANCY OF THE BLACK CHURCH, THE BLACK BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY SO MANY PEOPLE. THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT SO MANY FAMILIES ARE WORKING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR KIDS. THERE'S A LOT THAT WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF AND WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING AND LIFTING UP, BUT WE DO ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PEOPLE SAFE.

OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE BAIT AND SWITCH HERE. FOR 40 YEARS, EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS. YOU CAN GO AND SEE NEARLY, I THINK, 39, RETURNS, BUT EVERYONE HAS DONE IT. WE KNOW THE IRS HAS MADE CLEAR THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS?

THEY TALK GOOD AROUND ELECTION TIME LIKE RIGHT NOW, AND AFTER THE ELECTION, THEY SAY, SEE YOU LATER, I'LL SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY -- LOOK, THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE INNER CITIES HAS BEEN SO BADLY TREATED. THEY'VE BEEN ABUSED AND USED IN ORDER TO GET VOTES BY DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS. THEY CONTROL THESE COMMUNITIES FOR UP TO >> MR. TRUMP -- >> UNBROKEN. AND I WILL TELL YOU, YOU LOOK AT THE INNER CITIES AND I JUST LEFT DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND I JUST -- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE SEEN ME. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU DECIDED TO STAY HOME AND THAT'S OKAY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER AND I'VE MET SOME OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE I'LL EVER MEET WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES.

I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT GOT HIM TO PRODUCE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND I THINK I DID A GOOD JOB. SECRETARY CLINTON ALSO FOUGHT IT, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IN THE MAINSTREAM IS GOING TO SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE.

AND CLEARLY AS DONALD JUST ADMITTED, HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO STAND ON THIS DEBATE STAGE AND LESTER HOLT WAS GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE RACIST BIRTHER LIE TO BED. IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT WAS NOT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR IT, BUT HE PERSISTED. HE PERSISTED YEAR AFTER YEAR BECAUSE SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS, PEOPLE TO BRING HIM DOWN. >> MR. TRUMP, YOU CAN RESPOND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE NEXT SEGMENT. >> I WOULD LOVE TO RESPOND. FIRST OF ALL I GOT TO WATCH IN PREPARING FOR THIS SOME OF YOUR DEBATE AGAINST BARACK OBAMA. YOU TREATED HIM WITH TERRIBLE DISRESPECT AND I WATCHED THE WAY YOU TALK NOW ABOUT HOW LOVELY EVERYTHING IS AND HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE. DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. YOU WERE AFTER HIM. YOU WERE TRYING TO -- YOU EVEN SENT OUT, YOUR CAMPAIGN SENT OUT PICTURES OF HIM IN A CERTAIN GARB. VERY FAMOUS PICTURES. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DENY THAT. BUT JUST LAST WEEK YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER WEREN'T TAKEN CARE OF. IF SHE EVER WINS THIS RACE, THEY WON'T BE TAKEN CARE OF. >> MR. TRUMP, THIS YEAR SECRETARY CLINTON BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT BY A MAJOR PARTY. EARLIER THIS MONTH YOU SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE, \"A PRESIDENTIAL LOOK.\" SHE'S STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE STAMINA. TO BE PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY, YOU NEED TREMENDOUS STAMINA. >> THE QUOTE WAS \"I JUST DON'T THINK SHE HAS -- >> WAIT A MINUTE. YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION. DID SHE ASK ME A QUESTION? YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ON TRADE DEALS. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE -- THAT'S RIGHT, WITH JAPAN, WITH SAUDI ARABIA. I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE WE'RE DEFENDING SAUDI ARABIA AND WITH ALL OF THE MONEY THEY HAVE, WE'RE DEFENDING THEM AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK TO THEM. WAIT, YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA. >> LET'S LET HER RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS FRONT OF A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE, HE CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT STAMINA. >> THE WORLD -- LET ME TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS DURING THE LAST -- SO SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE THAT I AGREE, BUT IT'S BAD, BAD EXPERIENCE. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL THAT YOU'RE SO IN LOVE WITH WHERE WE GAVE THEM $150 BILLION BACK. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL, WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. AND THIS COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE. >> WE ARE AT THE -- WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION -- >> WELL, ONE THING -- >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- >> OKAY. GOOD. LET ME JUST TELL YOU -- >> MR. TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT NICE. BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE ADS ON ME. MANY OF WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE, THEY'RE UNTRUE AND MISREPRESENTATIONS. I WILL FELL YOU THIS, LESTER. IT'S NOT NICE AND I DON'T -- I DON'T DESERVE THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NICE THING THAT SHE'S DONE. IT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ADS AND THE ONLY GRATIFYING THING IS I SAW THE POLLS COME IN TODAY AND WITH ALL OF THAT MONEY, OVER $200 MILLION IS SPENT AND ARE POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING OUR TRADE DEALS. >> THE IRS SAYS AN AUDIT OF YOUR TAXES -- YOU'RE PERFECTLY FREE TO RELEASE YOUR TAXES DURING AN AUDIT. SO THE QUESTION, DOES THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW OUTWEIGH YOUR PERSONAL -- >> WELL, I TOLD YOU, I WILL RELEASE THEM AS SOON AS THE AUDIT -- LOOK, I'VE BEEN UNDER AUDIT ALMOST FOR 15 YEARS. I KNOW A LOT OF WEALTHY PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN AUDITED. I SAID, DO YOU GET AUDITED? I GET AUDITED ALMOST EVERY YEAR. AND IN A WAY, I SHOULD BE COMPLAINING. I'M NOT EVEN COMPLAINING. I DON'T MIND IT. IT'S ALMOST BECOME A WAY OF LIFE. I GET AUDITED BY THE IRS. OTHER PEOPLE DON'T. I WILL SAY THIS. WE HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE RELEASES THEM, I WILL RELEASE -- I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AND THAT'S AGAINST, MY LAWYERS THEY SAY DON'T DO IT. I WILL TELL YOU THIS. IN FACT, WATCHING SHOWS, READING THE PAPERS, ALMOST EVERY LAWYER SAYS YOU DON'T RELEASE YOUR RETURNS UNTIL THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE. WHEN THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE, I'LL DO IT BUT I WOULD GO AGAINST THEM IF SHE RELEASES HER E-MAILS >> SO IT'S NEGOTIABLE?

IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT WAS NOT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR IT, BUT HE PERSISTED. HE PERSISTED YEAR AFTER YEAR BECAUSE SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS, PEOPLE THAT HE WAS TRYING TO RESPOND.

GOOD. LET ME JUST TELL YOU -- >> MR. TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT NICE. BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE ADS ON ME. MANY OF WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE, THEY'RE UNTRUE AND MISREPRESENTATIONS. I WILL FELL YOU THIS, LESTER. IT'S NOT NICE AND I DON'T -- I DON'T DESERVE THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NICE THING THAT SHE'S DONE. IT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ADS AND THE ONLY GRATIFYING THING IS I SAW THE POLLS COME IN TODAY AND WITH ALL OF THAT GOOD. LET ME JUST TELL YOU -- >> MR. TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER.

I WILL FELL YOU THIS, LESTER. IT'S NOT NICE AND I DON'T -- I DON'T DESERVE THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NICE THING THAT SHE'S DONE. IT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ADS AND THE ONLY GRATIFYING THING IS I SAW THE POLLS COME IN TODAY AND WITH ALL OF THAT AUDIT OF YOUR TAXES -- YOU'RE PERFECTLY FREE TO RELEASE YOUR TAXES DURING AN AUDIT. SO THE QUESTION, DOES THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW OUTWEIGH YOUR PERSONAL -- >> WELL, I TOLD YOU, I WILL RELEASE THEM AS SOON AS THE AUDIT -- LOOK, I'VE BEEN UNDER AUDIT ALMOST FOR 15 YEARS. I KNOW A LOT OF WEALTHY PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN AUDITED. I SAID, DO YOU GET AUDITED? I GET AUDITED ALMOST EVERY YEAR. AND IN A WAY, I SHOULD BE COMPLAINING. I'M NOT EVEN COMPLAINING. I DON'T MIND IT. IT'S ALMOST BECOME A WAY OF LIFE. I GET AUDITED BY THE IRS. OTHER PEOPLE DON'T. I WILL SAY THIS. WE HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE RELEASES THEM, I WILL RELEASE -- I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AND THAT'S AGAINST, MY LAWYERS THEY SAY DON'T DO IT. I WILL TELL YOU THIS. IN FACT, WATCHING SHOWS, READING THE PAPERS, ALMOST EVERY LAWYER SAYS YOU DON'T RELEASE YOUR RETURNS UNTIL THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE. WHEN THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE, I'LL DO IT BUT I WOULD GO AGAINST THEM IF SHE RELEASES HER E-MAILS >> SO IT'S NEGOTIABLE? ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF BAIT AND SWITCH HERE. FOR 40 YEARS, EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS. YOU CAN GO AND SEE NEARLY, I THINK, 39, RETURNS, BUT EVERYONE HAS DONE IT. WE KNOW THE IRS HAS MADE CLEAR THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A CASINO LICENSE AND ANDGUESSING AT WHAT IT MIGHT BE THAT HE'S HIDING BUT I THINK THE QUESTION IS WERE HE EVER TO GET NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT WOULD BE THOSE CONFLICTS? WHO DOES HE OWE MONEY TO? WELL, HE OWES YOU THE ANSWERS TO THAT. AND HE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM. >> HE ALSO -- HE ALSO RAISED THE ISSUE OF YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE >> PLEASE RESPOND THEN I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. >> LOOK, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LET DOWN BY OUR POLITICIANS. THEY TALK GOOD AROUND ELECTION TIME LIKE RIGHT NOW, AND AFTER THE ELECTION, THEY SAY, SEE YOU LATER, I'LL SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS.

BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT GOT HIM TO PRODUCE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND I THINK I DID A GOOD JOB. SECRETARY CLINTON ALSO FOUGHT IT, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IN THE MAINSTREAM IS GOING TO SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE. SYDNEY BLUMENTHAL SENT THE REPORTER -- TAKE A LOOK AT CNN LAST WEEK, THE INTERVIEW WITH ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011. YOU CONTINUED TO TELL THE STORY AND QUESTION THE PRESIDENT'S LEGITIMACY IN 2012, RECENTLY AS JANUARY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? >> WELL, NOBODY WAS PRESSING IT. NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE. BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT GOT HIM TO PRODUCE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND I THINK I DID A GOOD JOB. SECRETARY CLINTON ALSO FOUGHT IT, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IN THE MAINSTREAM IS GOING TO SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE. SYDNEY BLUMENTHAL SENT THE REPORTER -- TAKE A LOOK AT CNN LAST WEEK, COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND I THINK I DID A GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT EVEN FOR THE PRESIDENT IN GETTING HIM TO PRODUCE HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HEARD. AND CLEARLY AS DONALD JUST ADMITTED, HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO STAND ON THIS DEBATE STAGE AND LESTER HOLT WAS GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE RACIST BIRTHER LIE TO BED. IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST LIE THAT OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT WAS NOT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR IT, BUT HE PERSISTED. HE PERSISTED YEAR AFTER YEAR BECAUSE SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS, PEOPLE THAT HE WAS TRYING TO TO BRING HIM DOWN. >> MR. TRUMP, YOU CAN RESPOND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE NEXT SEGMENT. >> I WOULD LOVE TO RESPOND. FIRST OF ALL I GOT TO WATCH IN PREPARING FOR THIS SOME OF YOUR DEBATE AGAINST BARACK OBAMA. YOU TREATED HIM WITH TERRIBLE DISRESPECT AND I WATCHED THE WAY YOU TALK NOW ABOUT HOW LOVELY EVERYTHING IS AND HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE. DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. YOU WERE AFTER HIM. YOU WERE TRYING TO -- YOU EVEN SENT OUT, YOUR CAMPAIGN SENT OUT PICTURES OF HIM IN A CERTAIN GARB. VERY FAMOUS PICTURES. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DENY THAT. BUT JUST LAST WEEK YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER RACE, THEY WON'T BE TAKEN CARE OF. >> MR. TRUMP, THIS YEAR SECRETARY CLINTON BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT BY A MAJOR PARTY. EARLIER THIS MONTH YOU SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE, \"A PRESIDENTIAL LOOK.\" SHE'S STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. I SAID SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE DOES HAVE THE STAMINA. TO BE PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY, YOU NEED TREMENDOUS STAMINA. >> THE QUOTE WAS \"I JUST DON'T THINK SHE HAS -- >> WAIT A MINUTE. YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION. DID SHE ASK ME A QUESTION? YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ON TRADE DEALS. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE -- THAT'S FRONT OF A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE, HE CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT STAMINA. >> THE WORLD -- LET ME TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS DURING THE LAST -- SO SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE THAT I AGREE, BUT IT'S BAD, BAD EXPERIENCE. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL THAT YOU'RE SO IN LOVE WITH WHERE WE GAVE THEM $150 BILLION BACK. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL, WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. AND THIS COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE. >> WE ARE AT THE -- WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION -- >> WELL, ONE THING -- >> VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE FINAL QUESTION. >> HE TRIED TO SWITCH FROM LOOKS TO STAMINA, BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. >> OKAY. GOOD. LET ME JUST TELL YOU -- >> MR. TRUMP, TEN SECONDS THEN WE'LL HAVE THE FINAL QUESTION. >> YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS HITTING ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS. SOME OF IT'S SAID IN ENTERTAINMENT, SOME OF IT SAID, SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. >> -- EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT NICE. BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE ADS ON ME. MANY OF WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE, THEY'RE UNTRUE AND MISREPRESENTATIONS. I WILL FELL YOU THIS, LESTER. IT'S NOT NICE AND I DON'T -- I DON'T DESERVE THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NICE THING THAT SHE'S DONE. IT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ADS AND THE ONLY GRATIFYING THING IS I SAW THE POLLS COME IN TODAY AND WITH ALL OF THAT MONEY, OVER $200 MILLION IS SPENT AND AUDIT OF YOUR TAXES -- YOU'RE PERFECTLY FREE TO RELEASE YOUR TAXES DURING AN AUDIT. SO THE QUESTION, DOES THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW OUTWEIGH YOUR PERSONAL -- >> WELL, I TOLD YOU, I WILL RELEASE THEM AS SOON AS THE AUDIT -- LOOK, I'VE BEEN UNDER AUDIT ALMOST FOR 15 YEARS. I KNOW A LOT OF WEALTHY PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN AUDITED. I SAID, DO YOU GET AUDITED? I GET AUDITED ALMOST EVERY YEAR. AND IN A WAY, I SHOULD BE COMPLAINING. I'M NOT EVEN COMPLAINING. I DON'T MIND IT. IT'S ALMOST BECOME A WAY OF LIFE. I GET AUDITED BY THE IRS. OTHER PEOPLE DON'T. I WILL SAY THIS. WE HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE RELEASES THEM, I WILL RELEASE -- I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AND THAT'S AGAINST, MY LAWYERS THEY SAY DON'T DO IT. I WILL TELL YOU THIS. IN FACT, WATCHING SHOWS, READING THE PAPERS, ALMOST EVERY LAWYER SAYS YOU DON'T RELEASE YOUR RETURNS UNTIL THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE. WHEN THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE, I'LL DO IT BUT I WOULD GO AGAINST THEM IF SHE RELEASES FOR 40 YEARS, EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS RELEASED THEIR TAX RETURNS. YOU CAN GO AND SEE NEARLY, I THINK, 39, RETURNS, BUT EVERYONE HAS DONE IT. WE KNOW THE IRS HAS MADE CLEAR THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN ANDGUESSING AT WHAT IT MIGHT BE THAT HE'S HIDING BUT I THINK THE QUESTION IS WERE HE EVER TO GET NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT WOULD BE THOSE CONFLICTS? WHO DOES HE OWE MONEY TO? WELL, HE OWES YOU THE ANSWERS TO THAT. AND HE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM. >> HE ALSO -- HE ALSO RAISED THE ISSUE OF YOUR E-MAILS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT? >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LET DOWN BY OUR POLITICIANS. THEY TALK GOOD AROUND ELECTION TIME LIKE RIGHT NOW, AND AFTER THE ELECTION, THEY SAY, SEE YOU LATER, I'LL SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY -- LOOK, THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE INNER CITIES HAS BEEN SO BADLY TREATED. THEY'VE BEEN ABUSED AND USED IN ORDER TO GET VOTES BY DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS. THEY CONTROL THESE COMMUNITIES FOR UP TO >> MR. TRUMP -- >> UNBROKEN. AND I WILL TELL YOU, YOU LOOK AT THE INNER CITIES AND I JUST LEFT DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA AND I JUST -- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE SEEN ME. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU DECIDED TO STAY HOME AND THAT'S OKAY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER AND I'VE MET SOME OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE I'LL EVER MEET WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY UPSET WITH WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE TOLD THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS THAT'S THE POINT. I WANT TO GET THE ANSWER HERE. THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS PRODUCED IN 2011.

THAT'S COALITION BUILDING. THAT'S WORKING WITH OTHER NATIONS. THE OTHER DAY, I SAW DONALD SAYING THAT THERE WERE SOME IRANIAN SAILORS ON A SHIP IN THE WATERS OFF OF IRAN AND THEY WERE TAUNTING AMERICAN SAILORS WHO WERE ON A NEARBY SHIP. HE SAID, YOU KNOW, IF THEY TAUNTED OUR SAILORS, I'D BLOW THEM OUT OF THE WATER AND START ANOTHER WAR. THAT'S -- >> THAT WOULD NOT START A WAR. >> THAT'S NOT JUDGMENT.

HE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT HE DIDN'T CARE IF OTHER NATIONS GOT NUCLEAR WEAPONS, JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, EVEN SAUDI ARABIA. IT HAS BEEN THE POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO DO EVERYTHING WE COULD TO REDUCE THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE EVEN SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THERE WERE NUCLEAR WAR IN THE EAST ASIA, WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S FINE, YOU KNOW. >> WRONG. >> HAVE A GOOD TIME, FOLKS.

I SAID, THERE'S A PERSON WITH A TEMPERAMENT THAT'S GOT AFTER YEAR BECAUSE SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS, PEOPLE THAT HE WAS TRYING TO TO BRING HIM DOWN. >> MR. TRUMP, YOU CAN RESPOND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE NEXT SEGMENT. >> I WOULD LOVE TO RESPOND. FIRST OF ALL I GOT TO WATCH IN PREPARING FOR THIS SOME OF YOUR DEBATE AGAINST BARACK OBAMA. YOU TREATED HIM WITH TERRIBLE DISRESPECT AND I WATCHED THE WAY YOU TALK NOW ABOUT HOW LOVELY EVERYTHING IS AND HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE. DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. YOU WERE AFTER HIM. YOU WERE TRYING TO -- YOU EVEN SENT OUT, YOUR CAMPAIGN SENT OUT PICTURES OF HIM IN A CERTAIN GARB. VERY FAMOUS PICTURES. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DENY THAT. BUT JUST LAST WEEK YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER IT. BUT REMEMBER, DONALD STARTED HIS CAREER BACK IN 1973 BEING SUED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT RENT APARTMENTS IN ONE OF HIS DEVELOPMENTS TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HE MADE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED FOR HIM UNDERSTOOD THAT WAS THE POLICY. HE ACTUALLY WAS SUED TWICE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO HE HAS A LONG TO BRING HIM DOWN. >> MR. TRUMP, YOU CAN RESPOND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE NEXT SEGMENT. >> I WOULD LOVE TO RESPOND. FIRST OF ALL I GOT TO WATCH IN PREPARING FOR THIS SOME OF YOUR DEBATE AGAINST BARACK OBAMA.

BUT JUST LAST WEEK YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER YOU EVEN SENT OUT, YOUR CAMPAIGN SENT OUT PICTURES OF HIM IN A CERTAIN GARB. VERY FAMOUS PICTURES. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DENY THAT. BUT JUST LAST WEEK YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID IT WAS TRUE. HOW MUCH WILL WE DO? THAT'S WHY I WAS SO SHOCKED WHEN DONALD THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND PERHAPS WE'RE NOT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA. COULD ALSO BE LOTS OF I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA. AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE VICIOUS TO ME, ROSIE O'DONNELL, I SAID VERY TOUGH THINGS TO HER AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT AND NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING -- >> PLEASE, VERY QUICK. HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS HARD.

MUSLIMS AT HOME. WHEN WE NEED TO BE COOPERATING WITH MUSLIM NATIONS AND WITH THE AMERICAN MUSLIM COMMUNITY. THEY'RE ON THE FRONT LINES. TOUGHER AND TOUGHER TO DEFE DEFEAT THEM. THEY'RE IN MORE AND MORE PLACES. >> MR. TRUMP. >> IT'S A BIG PROBLEM. AS FAR AS JAPAN IS CONCERNED, I WANT TO HELP ALL OF OUR ALLIES. WE'RE LOSING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE CANNOT BE THE POLICEMEN OF THE BEFORE OR RIGHT AFTER, TRUMP WAS DEFINITE BECAUSE IF YOU READ THIS ARTICLE, THERE'S NO DOUBT. BUT IF SOMEBODY, AND I'LL ASK THE PRESS, IF SOMEBODY WOULD CALL UP SEAN HANNITY, THIS WAS BEFORE THE WAR STARTED, HE AND I USED TO HAVE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE WAR. I SAID IT'S A TERRIBLE AND A STUPID THING. IT'S GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S DONE. >> MY REFERENCE WAS WHAT YOU HAD SAID IN MY QUESTION WAS -- >> YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT I SAID. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS. CLINTON'S? >> I HAVE MUCH BETTER JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I ALSO HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE HAS. YOU KNOW? I HAVE A MUCH BETTER -- SHE SPENT, LET ME TELL YOU, SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ADVERTISING -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, IT'S GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S DONE. >> MY REFERENCE WAS WHAT YOU HAD SAID IN MY QUESTION WAS -- >> YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT I SAID. >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY DIFFERENT THAN MRS.

LET ME TELL YOU. HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS DURING THE LAST -- SO SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE THAT I AGREE, BUT IT'S BAD, BAD EXPERIENCE.

I WILL FELL YOU THIS, LESTER. IT'S NOT NICE AND I DON'T -- I DON'T DESERVE THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NICE THING THAT SHE'S DONE.

AS SOON AS SHE RELEASES THEM, I WILL RELEASE -- I WILL FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET, MAYBE BY FAR, IS MY TEMPERAMENT.

AND I LOOK VERY, VERY MUCH FORWARD TO DOING IT. WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. >> OH, YEAH. >> -- THAT IS NOT THE FACTS. I DID SAY, I HOPED IT WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL. WHEN IT WAS NEGOTIATED -- SHOWS, READING THE PAPERS, ALMOST EVERY LAWYER SAYS YOU DON'T RELEASE YOUR RETURNS UNTIL THE AUDIT'S RETURNS, BUT EVERYONE HAS DONE IT. WE KNOW THE IRS HAS MADE CLEAR THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON RELEASING IT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK PRESIDENT. OVER -- ALMOST 4,000 PEOPLE IN CHICAGO HAVE BEEN KILLED. WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER. NOW, WHETHER OR NOT IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO YOU DO STOP AND FRISK, WHICH WORKED VERY WELL, MAYOR GIULIANI IS HERE, IT WORKED VERY WELL IN NEW YORK. THEN THERE ARE WAYS THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. STOP AND FRISK WAS FOUND TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND SYDNEY BLUMENTHAL WORKS FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF SECRETARY CLINTON. AND HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, PATTI DOYLE, WENT TO -- DURING THE CAMPAIGN, HER CAMPAIGN AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA, FOUGHT VERY HARD, AND YOU CAN GO LOOK IT UP AND YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT AND IF YOU LOOK AT CNN THIS PAST WEEK, PATTI DOYLE WAS ON \"WOLF BLITZER\" SAYING THAT THIS HAPPENED. BLUMENTHAL SENT McCLATCHY, HIGHLY RESPECTED REPORTER, TO KENYA TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT. >> WELL, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HEARD. AND CLEARLY AS DONALD JUST ADMITTED, HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO STAND ON THIS DEBATE STAGE AND LESTER HOLT WAS GOING TO BE ASKING US QUESTIONS, SO HE TRIED TO PUT THE WHOLE RACIST BIRTHER LIE TO BED. IT CAN'T BE DISMISSED THAT EASILY. HE HAS REALLY STARTED HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY BASED ON THIS RACIST AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I ALSO HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE HAS. YOU KNOW? I HAVE A MUCH BETTER -- SHE SPENT, LET ME TELL YOU, SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ADVERTISING -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT.

THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS, AND DOGS AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS. WHO HAS SAID -- >> I NEVER SAID THAT. >> WHO HAVE SAID WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY UNLESS THEY DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN. >> DIDN'T SAY. >> AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT A WOMAN IN A BEAUTY CONTEST.

IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT NICE. BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE ADS ON ME. MANY OF WHICH ARE AND CLOSE THE CORPORATE LOOPHOLES. FINALLY WE TONIGHT ARE ON THE STAGE TOGETHER, DONALD TRUMP AND I. DONALD, IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEBATE WHERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY. YOU HAVE TO JUDGE US. BUT THE POLITICIANS HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, FIGHTING -- NO WONDER YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING ISIS YOUR ENTIRE ADULT LIFE. THE WEALTHY. SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU'RE CALLING FOR A TAX INCREASE ON THE INNER CITIES AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS AND IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL BUT WE HAVE NO LEADERSHIP AND HONESTLY, THAT STARTS WITH SECRETARY CLINTON. >> ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE IS TWO MINUTES OF THE SAME QUESTION TO DEFEND TAX INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, RESPOND. >> WELL, AS SOON AS HE TRAVELS TO 112 COUNTRIES AND NEGOTIATES A PEACE DEAL, A CEASE-FIRE, A RELEASE OF DISSIDENTS, AN OPENING OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, OR EVEN SPENDS IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY. YOU HAVE TO JUDGE US. THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE REALLY WORK TO GET NEW JOBS AND TO GET EXPORTS THAT HELP TO CREATE MORE NEW JOBS. >> VERY QUICKLY -- >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN 30 YEARS OR 26 YEARS. >> I'VE BEEN A SENATOR, DONALD. >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. >> I'VE BEEN A SENATOR, DONALD. >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. >> I'VE BEEN SECRETARY YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF IT THEN HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING HOW BAD IT IS AND SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE. YUAN IF Y YOU KNOW IF YOU DID WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT AND ALMOST BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. NOTHING WILL TOP NANAFA. >> THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. I WAS AGAINST IT ONCE IT WAS FINALLY NEGOTIATED. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING AND ANY BUSINESS CONFLICTS. DON'T AMERICANS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST? ARE POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING OUR TRADE DEALS. >> THE IRS SAYS AN AUDIT OF YOUR TAXES -- YOU'RE PERFECTLY FREE TO RELEASE YOUR TAXES DURING AN AUDIT. SO THE QUESTION, DOES THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW OUTWEIGH YOUR PERSONAL -- >> WELL, I TOLD YOU, I THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE YOU'RE UNDER AUDIT. SO YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY WON'T HE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? AND I THINK THERE MAY BE A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS HE SAYS HE IS. SECOND, MAYBE HE'S NOT AS CHARITABLE AS HE CLAIMS TO BE. THIRD, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THROUGH INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HE OWES ABOUT $650 MILLION TO WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO SEE AND I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S EVER >> I DO. YOU KNOW, I MADE A MISTAKE USING A PRIVATE E-MAIL. >> THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AND IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD OBVIOUSLY DO IT DIFFERENTLY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. >> MR. TRUMP? >> THAT WAS MORE THAN A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. OKAY? THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE. THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING THE 5th AMENDMENT, TAKING THE PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER TAKING THE 5th, I IMPORTANT -- >> IT WOULD BE SQUANDERED, TOO, BELIEVE ME. >> -- IS IF YOUR MAIN CLAIM TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS YOUR BUSINESS, THEN I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW, YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID THAT YOU BUILT A LOT OF BUSINESSES ON THE BACKS OF LITTLE GUYS, AND INDEED, I HAVE MET WORK THAT YOU ASKED THEM TO DO. WE HAVE AN ARCHITECT IN THE AUDIENCE WHO DESIGNED ONE OF YOUR CLUBHOUSES AT ONE OF YOUR GOLF COURSES. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FACILITY. IT IMMEDIATELY WAS PUT TO USE. AND YOU WOULDN'T PAY WHAT THE MAN NEEDED TO BE PAID WHAT HE WAS CHARGING YOU -- >> MAYBE HE DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB AND I WAS UNSATISFIED WITH HIS WORK WHICH OUR COUNTRY SHOULD DO, TOO. >> THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE STIFFED OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR THAT ARE THERE AND WHEN SECRETARY CLINTON TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T GET PAID, FIRST OF ALL, THEY DID GET PAID A LOT, BUT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS OF THE NATION. NOW, IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE LAWS, YOU'VE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME, CHANGE THE LAW. BUT I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS OF THE NATION BECAUSE I'M RUNNING A COMPANY, MY >> SECRETARY CLINTON, LAST WEEK YOU SAID WE'VE GOT DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE POLICING TO GO RIGHT AT IMPLICIT BIAS. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT POLICE ARE IMPLICITLY BIASED AGAINST BLACK TERMINATED BY CURRENT MAYOR. BUT STOP AND FRISK HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE SAFETY OF NEW YORK CITY, TREMENDOUS BEYOND BELIEF. SO WHEN YOU SAY IT HAS NO IMPACT, IT REALLY DID. IT HAD A VERY, VERY BIG IMPACT. >> WELL, IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY, IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS, THAT UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR, CRIME HAS CONTINUED TO DROP FAST. WHEN ISIS FORMED IN THIS VACUUM CREATED BY BARACK OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON, AND BELIEVE ME, YOU WERE THE ONES THAT TOOK OUT THE TROOPS. NOT ONLY THAT, YOU NAMED THE DAY. THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THEY SAT BACK PROBABLY AND SAID -- >> LESTER, WE COVERED THIS -- >> WAIT A MINUTE. THEY SAID WAIT A MINUTE, WHEN THEY FORMED, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. NOW YOU'RE TALKING I DON'T THINK SO. >> MR. TRUMP, WITH A LOT OF THESE ARE JUDGMENT QUESTIONS. YOU HAD SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE THE INVASION. WHAT MAKES YOUR -- >> I DID NOT SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ. >> 2002 -- >> THAT IS A MAINSTREAM MEDIA NONSENSE PUT OUT BY HER BECAUSE SHE FRANKLY I THINK THE BEST PERSON IN HER CAMPAIGN IS MAINSTREAM MEDIA. >> MY QUESTION -- >> WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR? I WAS AGAINST -- WAIT A MINUTE. I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. JUST SO YOU PUT IT OUT. >> THE RECORD SHOWS OTHERWISE. WHY -- >> THE RECORD DOES NOT SHOW -- >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY -- >> THE RECORD SHOWS THAT I'M RIGHT. WHEN I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD STERN, VERY LIKELY DEALS. WE ALSO, THOUGH, NEED TO HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT REWARDS WORK AND NOT JUST FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. AND THE KIND OF PLAN THAT DONALD HAS PUT FORTH WOULD BE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN, IN FACT, IT WOULD BE THE MOST EXTREME VERSION, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AGREE THAT THIS SHOULD BE DONE. $2.5 TRILLION. I HAPPEN TO THINK IT'S DOUBLE THAT. PROBABLY $5 TRILLION THAT WE CAN BRING INTO OUR COUNTRY, LESTER, AND WITH A LITTLE LEADERSHIP YOU'D GET IT IN HERE VERY QUICKLY AND IT COULD BE PUT TO USE ON THE INNER CITIES AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS AND IT THIS JANET YELLEN OF THE FED, THE FED IS DOING POLITICAL BY KEEPING THE INTEREST RATES AT THIS LEVEL, AND BELIEVE ME, THE DAY OBAMA GOES OFF AND HE LEAVES AND GOES OUT TO THE GOLF COURSE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE TO PLAY GOLF, WHEN THEY RAISE INTEREST RATES, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME VERY BAD THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE THE FED IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB. BACKS OF LITTLE GUYS, AND INDEED, I HAVE MET A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE STIFFED BY YOU AND YOUR BUSINESSES, DONALD. I'VE MET DISHWASHERS, PAINTERS, ARCHITECTS, GLASS INSTALLERS, MARBLE INSTALLERS, DRAPERY INSTALLERS LIKE MY DAD WAS, WHO YOU REFUSED TO PAY THEY'RE GONE. AND HILLARY, I JUST ASK YOU THIS, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS. WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS. >> WELL, ACTUALLY -- I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE RELEASES THEM, I WILL RELEASE -- I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AND THAT'S AGAINST, MY LAWYERS THEY SAY DON'T DO IT. I WILL TELL YOU THIS. IN FACT, WATCHING SHOWS, READING THE PAPERS, ALMOST EVERY LAWYER SAYS YOU DON'T RELEASE YOUR RETURNS UNTIL THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE. WHEN THE AUDIT'S COMPLETE, I'LL DO IT BUT I WOULD GO AGAINST THEM IF SHE RELEASES HER E-MAILS >> SO IT'S NEGOTIABLE? THAT'S LAW AND ORDER. WE NEED LAW AND ORDER. IF WE DON'T HAVE IT, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY, AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHARLOTTE, A CITY I LOVE, A CITY WHERE I HAVE INVESTMENTS, WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON THROUGHOUT VARIOUS PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY, WHETHER IT'S -- I MEAN, I CAN JUST KEEP VERY -- I MEAN, A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE OUR INNER CITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS DURING THE LAST -- SO SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE THAT I AGREE, BUT IT'S BAD, BAD EXPERIENCE. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL THAT YOU'RE SO IN LOVE WITH WHERE WE GAVE THEM $150 BILLION BACK. WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL, WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING YOU -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL. I AGREE, SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. CHINA 50%. SO I KNOW HOW TO REALLY WORK TO GET NEW JOBS AND TO GET EXPORTS THAT HELP TO CREATE MORE NEW JOBS. >> VERY QUICKLY -- >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN 30 YEARS OR 26 YEARS. >> I'VE BEEN A SENATOR, DONALD. >> YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. NA N NAFTA IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL SIGNED ANYWHERE, IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW YOU WANT TO APPROVE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF IT THEN HEARD WHAT I WAS SAYING HOW BAD IT IS AND SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE. THE TERMS WERE LAID OUT. I WROTE -- >> YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD. WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, SECRETARY CLINTON. >> I HAVE A FEELING BY THE END OF THIS EVENING I'M GOING TO BE BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED. >> WHY NOT. >> WHY NOT, YEAH. WHY NOT. YOU KNOW, JUST JOIN THE DEBATE BY SAYING MORE CRAZY THINGS. NOW -- >> HEY, THERE'S NOTHING CRAZY ABOUT THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS AGAINST MY LAWYER'S WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER HAVE BEEN DELETED. AS SOON AS SHE IT'S REALLY A SHAME. IT'S POLITICIANS LIKE SECRETARY CLINTON THAT HAVE CAUSED THIS PROBLEM. OUR COUNTRY HAS TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS. WE'RE A DEBTOR NATION. WE'RE A SERIOUS DEBTOR NATION. AND WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT NEEDS NEW ROADS, NEW TUNNELS, NEW BRIDGES, NEW AIRPORTS, NEW SCHOOLS, NEW A MINUTE. I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. JUST SO YOU PUT IT OUT. >> THE RECORD SHOWS OTHERWISE. WHY -- >> THE RECORD DOES NOT SHOW -- >> WHY IS YOUR JUDGMENT ANY -- >> THE RECORD SHOWS THAT I'M RIGHT. WHEN I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD STERN, VERY LIKELY FIRST TIME ANYONE'S ASKED ME THAT, I SAID, VERY LIKEL LI DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. GO TO HER WEBSITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT ISIS ON HER WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MacARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH. >> THE NEXT SEGMENT -- >> AT LEAST I HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. >> NO, NO, YOU'RE TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO. >> NO, WE'RE NOT. >> SEE, YOU TELLING THE ENEMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE, FIGHTING -- NO WONDER YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING I ALSO HAVE A MUCH BETTER TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE HAS. YOU KNOW? I HAVE A MUCH BETTER -- SHE SPENT, LET ME TELL YOU, SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AN ADVERTISING -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, TEMPERAMENT, LET'S GO AFTER IT. I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET, MAYBE BY FAR, IS MY TEMPERAMENT. I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT. I KNOW HOW TO WIN. SHE DOES NOT -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON? >> WAIT. THE AFL-CIO THE OTHER DAY BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY INNER CITIES AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS AND IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL BUT WE HAVE NO LEADERSHIP AND HONESTLY, THAT STARTS WITH SECRETARY CLINTON. >> ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE IS TWO MINUTES OF THE SAME QUESTION TO DEFEND TAX INCREASES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS, FAMILY. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT -- >> HOW MUCH, HOW MUCH? LESTER, HOW MUCH? >> IT S AS I SAID, TRUMPED UP TRICKLE DOWN. TRICKLE DOWN DID NOT CITY, STOP AND FRISK, WE HAD 2,200 MURDERS AND STOP AND FRISK BROUGHT IT DOWN TO 500 MURDERS. OF MURDERS. HARD TO BELIEVE. TO BE GOOD? BUT WE WENT FROM 2,200 TO 500 AND IT WAS CONTINUED ON BY MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND IT WAS TERMINATED BY CURRENT MAYOR. BUT STOP AND FRISK HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE SAFETY OF NEW YORK CITY, TREMENDOUS BEYOND BELIEF. SO WHEN YOU SAY IT HAS NO IMPACT, IT REALLY DID. IT HAD A VERY, VERY BIG IMPACT. >> WELL, IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY, IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAYORS, THAT UNDER THE CURRENT MAYOR, CRIME DONE. >> MR. TRUMP -- >> I THINK DONALD JUST CRITICIZED ME FOR PREPARING FOR THIS DEBATE. WALL STREET AND FOREIGN BANKS. OR MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT, TO KNOW THAT HE'S PAID NOTHING IN FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE THE ONLY YEARS THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO TURN THEM OVER TO STATE AUTHORITIES WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GET A SAID. WE SHOULD BE BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND PERHAPS WE'RE NOT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC. SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, BUT I DON'T -- MAYBE IT WAS. IT COULD BE RUSSIA. COULD ALSO BE CHINA. AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. BACKS OF LITTLE GUYS, AND INDEED, I HAVE MET A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE STIFFED BY YOU AND YOUR BUSINESSES, DONALD. I'VE MET DISHWASHERS, PAINTERS, ARCHITECTS, GLASS INSTALLERS, MARBLE INSTALLERS, DRAPERY INSTALLERS LIKE MY DAD WAS, WHO THINK YOU'LL AGREE BECAUSE I SAID IT TO YOU ONCE, HAD WE TAKEN THE OIL, AND WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE OIL, ISIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM EITHER BECAUSE THE OIL WAS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF INCOME AND NOW THEY HAVE THE OIL ALL OVER THE PLACE AND REALLY WORKING HARD. DONALD SUPPORTED THE INVASION OF IRAQ. >> WRONG. >> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY -- >> WRONG. >> -- PROVED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. >> WRONG. >> HE ACTUALLY ADVOCATED FOR THE ACTIONS WE TOOK IN LIBYA. AND URGED THAT GADHAFI MUSLIMS ABROAD. MUSLIMS AT HOME. WHEN WE NEED TO BE COOPERATING WITH MUSLIM NATIONS AND WITH THE AMERICAN MUSLIM COMMUNITY. THEY'RE ON THE FRONT LINES. HAVE THE GREATEST MESS ANYONE'S EVER SEEN. YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST. IT'S A TOTAL MESS. UNDER YOUR DIRECTION TO A LARGE EXTENT, BUT YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU STARTED THE IRAN DEAL. THAT'S ANOTHER BEAUTY WHERE YOU HAVE A COUNTRY THAT WAS READY AVENUE INTO A ROOM, THEY PUT NAMES -- OH, >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I THAT? >> FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS. THEY ARE SAID. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT. ON POLITICS, POLICIES, PRINCIPLE, BUT I NEVER WHAT HE DOES TO WOMEN. AND HE HAS SAID THAT THE VIDEO DOESN'T REPRESENT WHO HE IS. BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR TO ANYONE WHO HEARD IT THAT IT REPRESENTS EXACTLY WHO HE IS. >> MR. FRUMP -- I WANT TO GET TO AUDIENCE QUESTIONS ONLINE QUESTIONS. >> SO, SHE'S ALLOWED TO DO THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, I WAS SO SURPRISED SEE HIM SIGN ON WITH THE DEVIL. BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT APOLOGY, I THINK THE ONE THAT SHOULD YOU REALLY BE APOLOGIZING FOR, THE I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST TAKING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION SERIOUSLY AND AS I SAID THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ENDED UP IN THE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON YOU YOU CAN RESPOND WE HAVE TO MOVE ON TO AUDIENCE QUESTION. >> LOOK, IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. PLEASE, GO TO -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON YOU YOU CAN RESPOND WE HAVE TO MOVE ON TO AUDIENCE QUESTION. >> LOOK, IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. PLEASE, GO TO -- >> ALLOW HER TO RESPOND. ALLOW HER TO RESPOND. >> LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. >>  THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT TONIGHT. LET'S GET TO THEIR QUESTION. >> THE QUESTION HERE FROM KEN KARPOWICZ, A QUESTION ABOUT HEALTH CARE. >> ANDERSON WHY AREN'T YOU BRINGING UP THE E-MAILS? >> YOU BROUGHT UP THE E-MAILS. >> IT HASN'T. >>  THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT TONIGHT. LET'S GET TO THEIR QUESTION. >> THE QUESTION HERE FROM KEN KARPOWICZ, A QUESTION ABOUT HEALTH CARE. >> ANDERSON WHY AREN'T YOU COSTS DOWN AND MAKE COVERAGE BETTER. >> THAT FIRST ONE GOES TO SECRETARY CLINTON YOU STARTED OUT WITH THE LAST ONE TO THE AUDIENCE. >> HE WANTS TO START, HE CAN THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED. NOT TRUE. I'M SORRY I HAVE TO KEEP SAYING THIS, BUT HE LIVES IN AN ALTERNATIVE REALITY. AND IT IS SORT OF AMUSING TO HEAR SOMEBODY WHO HASN'T PAID FEDERAL INFORMATION TAXES IN MAYBE 20 YEARS TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO. BUT I'LL TELL WHAT YOU HE'S GOING TO DO. HIS PLAN WILL GIVE THE WEALTHY RID OF CARRIED INTEREST FOR YEARS. STARTING WHEN I WAS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK. BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT HERE. >> WHY DIDN'T DO YOU IT? >> LET MERE RESPOND. >> I WAS SENATOR WITH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL BE THE -- AMBITIONS AND AGGRESSIVENESS OF RUSSIA. RUSSIA HAS DECIDED THAT IT'S ALL IN IN SYRIA. AND THEY HAVE ALSO DECIDED WHO THEY WANT TO SEE BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TOO, IT'S NOT ME. I'VE STOOD UP TO RUSSIA, I'VE THE RUSSIANS, TRY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. >> THANK YOU SECRETARY -- WHILE SHE'S THERE AS SECRETARY OF STATE WITH THE SO-CALLED LINE IN THE SAND. WHICH -- >> NO, I WASN'T. TIRED, WE'RE EXHAUSTED IN TERMS OF NUCLEAR. A VERY BAD THING. SHE TALKS TOUGH, SHE TALKS REALLY TOUGH AGAINST PUTIN AND REBELS ARE. >> MR. TRUMP -- YOUR TWO MINUTES IS UP. >> I DON'T LIKE ASSAD AT ALL. BUT ASSAD IS KILLING ISIS. RUSSIA IS KILLING ISIS. IRAN IS KILLING ISIS. IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT SYRIA AND THE PEOPLE. >> I WAS SORRY THE WAY I TALKED ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE MY ARGUMENT WITH INNER CITIES, BIGGEST IN 45 YEARS. WE HAVE A DIVIDED NATION, BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE HER, BELIEVE WITH INNER CITIES, BIGGEST IN 45 YEARS. WE HAVE A DIVIDED NATION, BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE HER, BELIEVE ME, SHE HAS TREMENDOUS HATE IN I WILL SAY THIS ABOUT HILLARY. SHE DOESN'T QUIT, SHE DOESN'T >> POCK, DONALD. I KNOW YOU'RE IN TO BIG DIVERSION TONIGHT, ANYTHING TO AVOID TALKING ABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN THE WAY IT'S EXPLODING THE WAY REPUBLICANS ARE LEAVING YOU. >> LET'S SHE WHAT HAPPENS -- ALLOW HER TO RESPOND. >> LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. >>  THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT TONIGHT. LET'S GET TO THEIR QUESTION. >> THE QUESTION HERE FROM KEN KARPOWICZ, A QUESTION ABOUT HEALTH CARE. >> ANDERSON WHY AREN'T YOU BRINGING UP THE E-MAILS? DAY. >> MR. TRUMP? >> WELL, I CONSIDER HER STATEMENT ABOUT MY CHILDREN TO BE A VERY NICE COMPLIMENT. I DON'T KNOW FIT WAS MEANT TO BE COMPLIMENT BUT IT IS -- I'M VERY PROUD OF MY CHILDREN. THEY HAVE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB AND THEY HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL KIDS. I CONSIDER THAT A COMPLIMENT. I WILL SAY THIS ABOUT HILLARY. SHE DOESN'T QUIT, SHE DOESN'T GIVE UP. I RESPECT THAT. I TELL IT LIKE IT IS. SHE'S A FIGHTER. I DISAGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT SHE'S FIGHTING FOR. I DID DISAGREE WITH HER JUDGMENT AND MANY CASES. BUT SHE DOES FIGHT HARD AND SHE DOESN'T QUIT AND SHE DOESN'T GIVE UP, I CONSIDER THAT TO BE A VERY GOOD TRAIT. >> THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] >> WANT TO THANK BOTH CANDIDATES, WANTED TO THANK THE UNIVERSITY HERE, THIS CONCLUDES THE TOWN HALL MEETING OUR THANKS TO CANDIDATES, THE COMMISSION, WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY TO EVERYBODY WHO WATCHED. >> POCK, DONALD. I KNOW YOU'RE IN TO BIG DIVERSION TONIGHT, ANYTHING TO AVOID TALKING ABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN THE WAY IT'S EXPLODING THE WAY REPUBLICANS ARE LEAVING YOU. >> LET'S SHE WHAT HAPPENS -- ALLOW HER TO RESPOND. >> LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. >>  THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT TONIGHT. LET'S GET TO THEIR QUESTION. >> THE QUESTION HERE FROM KEN KARPOWICZ, A QUESTION ABOUT HEALTH CARE. >> ANDERSON WHY AREN'T YOU BRINGING UP THE E-MAILS? >> YOU BROUGHT UP THE E-MAILS. >> IT HASN'T. AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHEN I WATCH THE DEALS BEING MADE, WHEN I WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH SOME HORRIBLE THINGS LIKE OBAMACARE WHERE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE AND HEALTHCARE GRABBING THEIR GENITALS THAT IS SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU DRAGGED THAT YOU HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK. WHEN WE HAVE A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE ISIS CHOPPING OFF HEADS, WHERE YOU HAVE -- FRANKLY DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES WHERE YOU HAVE WARS AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SITES ALL OVER, WHERE YOU HAVE SO MANY BAD THINGS HAPPENING, THIS IS LIKE MEDIEVAL TIMES, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THE CARNAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND THEY LOOK AND THEY SEE, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRANKLY DOING SO WELL AGAINST US WITH ISIS. AND THEY LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY THEY SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. YES, I'M VERY EMBARRASSED BY IT. I HATE IT. SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK. WHEN WE HAVE A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE ISIS CHOPPING OFF HEADS, WHERE YOU HAVE -- FRANKLY DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES WHERE YOU HAVE WARS AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SITES ALL OVER, WHERE YOU HAVE SO MANY BAD THINGS HAPPENING, THIS IS LIKE MEDIEVAL TIMES, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THE CARNAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND THEY LOOK AND THEY SEE, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRANKLY DOING SO WELL AGAINST US WITH ISIS. AND THEY LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY THEY SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. YES, I'M VERY EMBARRASSED BY IT. I HATE IT. BUT IT'S LOCKER ROOM TALK. AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS, I WILL KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS. WE'RE GOING TO DEFEAT ISIS. ISIS HAPPENED NUMBER OF YEARS AGO IN A VACUUM THAT WAS LEFT BECAUSE OF BAD JUDGMENT I WELL TELL YOU, I WILL TAKE CARE OF ISIS. >> MR. TRUMP -- GET ON TO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THINGS AND MUCH BIGGER THINGS. >> JUST FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO THAT DID YOU NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONCEMENT. >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN. NO ONE HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO. >> YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEVER DID THAT? >> FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS. THEY ARE SAID. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT. BUT I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR WOMEN. >> HAVE YOU EVER DONE -- I HAVE RESPECT FOR ME. >> WELL, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING OVER THE LAST 48 HOURS ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD AND SAW. YOU KNOW, WITH PRIOR REPUBLICAN NOMINEES FOR PRESIDENT, I DISAGREED WITH THEM. ON POLITICS, POLICIES, PRINCIPLE, BUT I NEVER QUESTIONED THEIR FITNESS TO SERVE. DONALD TRUMP IS DIFFERENT. I SAID STARTING BACK IN JUNE THAT HE WAS NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF. AND MANY REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS HAVE SAID THE SAME THING. WHAT WE ALL SAW AND HEARD ON FRIDAY WAS DONALD TALKING ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE DOES TO WOMEN. AND HE HAS SAID THAT THE VIDEO DOESN'T REPRESENT WHO HE IS. BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR TO ANYONE WHO HEARD IT THAT IT REPRESENTS EXACTLY WHO HE IS. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE SEEN HIM INSULT WOMEN. WE HAVE SEEN HIM RATE WOMEN ON THEIR APPEARANCE, RANKING THEM FROM ONE TO TEN. WE'VE SEEN HIM EMBARRASS WOMEN ON TV AND ON TWITTER. WE SAW HIM AFTER THE FIRST DEBATE DEPEND NEARLY A WEEK DENIGRATING A FORMER MISS UNIVERSE IN THE HARSHEST, POST PERSONAL TERM. SO, YES, THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP S. BUT IT'S NOT ONLY WOMEN AND IT'S NOT ONLY THIS VIDEO THAT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FITNESS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE HE HAS ALSO TARGETED IMMIGRANTS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, LATINOS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, P.O.W.s, MUSLIMS, SO MANY OTHERS. SO THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. THE QUESTION FOR US, THE QUESTION OUR COUNTRY MUST ANSWER IS, THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT'S WHY TO GO BACK TO YOUR QUESTION, I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE, WE ALL SHOULD, TO EVERY I AM NOT PROUD OF IT. I AM A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS NATION THAT HAS BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT HIM OFF AND SHE SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, LAUGHING AT THE GIRL WHO WAS RAPED. KATHY SHELTON, THAT YOUNG WOMAN, IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT. SO, DON'T TELL ME ABOUT WORDS. I AM ABSOLUTELY, I APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAY. BUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID, HE WAS IMPEACHED, HE LOST HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. HE HAD TO PAY AN $850,000 FINE TO ONE OF THE WOMEN. PAULA JONES, WHO IS ALSO HERE TONIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAYING, SO MUCH OF WHAT HE'S JUST SAID IS NOT RIGHT BUT HE GETS TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN ANYWAY HE CHOOSES. GETS TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. INSTEAD OF ANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS, TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENDA, LAYING OUT THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE THINKING MAKE A BETTER LIFE AND A BETTER COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, OFFICE AND ARE NOW MISSING. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I DIDN'T THINK I'D SAY THIS BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT. I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU GET A SUBPOENA, AND AFTER YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED. IN THE FIRST DEBATE -- >> THE AUDIENCE NEEDS TO CALL DOWN HERE. >> -- WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FACT CHECKING DONALD ALL THE TIME. I'D NEVER GET TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT TO DO, HOW WE'RE GOING TO REALLY MAKE LIVES BETTER FOR PEOPLE. SO, ONCE AGAIN, GO TO YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED. IN THE FIRST DEBATE -- >> THE AUDIENCE NEEDS TO CALL DOWN HERE. >> -- WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FACT CHECKING DONALD ALL THE TIME. I'D NEVER GET TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT TO DO, HOW WE'RE GOING TO REALLY MAKE LIVES MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP CRITICS AND OTHERS. AFTER A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANYONE HACKED THE SERVER I WAS USING. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY ONE CAN POINTED TO, AT ALL, >> IT'S CALLED EXTREME VETTING. WE ARE GOING TO AREAS LIKE SYRIA WHERE THEY'RE COMING IN BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS BECAUSE OF BARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT SYRIA AND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN ALEPPO I WANT TO REMIND YOU WHAT YOUR RUNNING MATE SAID. PROVOCATIONS BY RUSSIA NEED TO BE MET WITH AMERICAN STRENGTH THAT IF RUSSIA CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN AIRSTRIKES ALONG WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES OF ASSAD, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE PREPARED TO USE MILITARY FORCE BE ONE MORE VERY LONG. IN THE DAYS AFTER FIRST DEBATE YOU SEPTEMBER OUT SERIES OF TWEETS FROM 3:00 A.M. TO 5:00 A.M. IN CLUING ONE THAT TOLD PEOPLE CHECK OUT SEX TAME. IS THAT THE DISCIPLINE -- THIS IS NOT AN ORDINARY TIME AND THIS IS NOT AN ORDINARY ELECTION. WE ARE GOING TO BE CHOOSING A PRESIDENT WHO WILL SET POLICY FOR NOT JUST FOUR OR EIGHT YEARS BUT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE HERE AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD, FROM THE SUPREME COURT, TO ENERGY AND SO MUCH ELSE. EXCEPT FOR NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT, JOHN ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD AND SAW. YOU KNOW, WITH PRIOR REPUBLICAN RESPOND WE HAVE TO MOVE ON TO AUDIENCE QUESTION. >> LOOK, IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. PLEASE, GO TO -- >> ALLOW HER TO RESPOND. >> PERSONAL E-MAILS, NOT A -- >> WELL, WE TURNED OVER 35,000. >> OH, YEAH, WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER -- >> PLEASE ALLOW HER TO RESPOND. SHE DIDN'T TALK WHILE YOU TALKED. >> THAT'S TRUE, I DIDN'T. >> BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. >> THE FIRST DEBATE I'LL TRY NOT TO IN THIS DEBATE BECAUSE I'D WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I AND THEY LOOK AND THEY SEE, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRANKLY DOING SO WELL AGAINST US WITH ISIS. AND THEY LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY THEY SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. YES, I'M VERY EMBARRASSED BY IT. I HATE IT. BECAUSE OF BAD JUDGMENT I WELL TELL YOU, I WILL TAKE CARE OF I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND I'M GOING TO FIX IT. BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU. PREMIUMS HAVE GOTTEN TOO HIGH, COPAYS, DEDUCTIBLES, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS COSTS AND I'VE LAID OUT A SERIES OF >> WELL, RIGHT, AS I RECALL THAT LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN THAT'S ONE THAT I HAVEN'T -- OF THE ASSAD REGIME. >> OKAY. HE AND I HAVEN'T SPOKEN I DISAGREE. YOU. DISAGREE WITH YOUR RUNNING MATE. >> RIGHT NOW, SYRIA IS FIGHTING VERY RICH NATION. VERY, VERY QUICKLY. VERY, VERY QUICKLY. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO GET ISIS. TO BACK UP DIPLOMACY? >> I WOULD NOT USE AMERICAN GROUND FORCES IN SYRIA. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE. I DON'T THINK AMERICAN TROOPS SHOULD BE HOLDING TERRITORY, WHICH IS WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO AS AN OCCUPYING FORCE, I DON'T THINK THAT IS A SMART STRATEGY. I DO THINK THE USE OF SPECIAL FORCES WHICH WE'RE USING, THE >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD AND SAW. YOU KNOW, WITH PRIOR REPUBLICAN NOMINEES FOR PRESIDENT, I DISAGREED WITH THEM. ON POLITICS, POLICIES, PRINCIPLE, BUT I NEVER DOESN'T REPRESENT WHO HE IS. BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR TO ANYONE WHO HEARD IT THAT IT REPRESENTS EXACTLY WHO HE IS. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE SEEN HIM INSULT WOMEN. DOESN'T REPRESENT WHO HE IS. BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR TO ANYONE WHO HEARD IT THAT IT REPRESENTS EXACTLY WHO HE IS. PERSONAL TERM. SO, YES, THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP S. BUT IT'S NOT ONLY WOMEN AND IT'S NOT ONLY THIS VIDEO THAT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FITNESS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE HE HAS ALSO TARGETED IMMIGRANTS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, LATINOS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, P.O.W.s, MUSLIMS, SO MANY OTHERS. SO THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. THE QUESTION FOR US, THE TRUMP S. BUT IT'S NOT ONLY WOMEN AND IT'S NOT ONLY THIS VIDEO THAT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FITNESS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE HE HAS ALSO TARGETED IMMIGRANTS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, UNTIL JUST RECENTLY? AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES -- >> AS I TOLD THAT YOU WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I AM NOT PROUD OF IT. I AM A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, >> WELL, FIRST, LET ME START BY COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, SQUARE, IN MY OPINION. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TAKE A LOOK AT WIKILEAKS SEE WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS AND DEBRA MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST OBVIOUSLY IF I WERE TO DO IT OVER AGAIN I WOULD NOT. I'M NOT MAKING ANY EXCUSES. SECRETS THAT WE POSSESS, SUCH AS GOING AFTER BIN LADEN. WRONG HANDS. >> WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON. >> AND YET SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE WORD -- LET SNEER C\" ON DOCUME DOCUMENT, RIGHT, SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT WORD -- WHAT THAT LETTER MEANT. IT'S AMAZING I'M WATCHING MIL REGO OVER FACTS. SHE'S GOING AFTER FACT AFTER FACT. SHE'S LYING AGAIN. BUT FOR YOU TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU DELETING 39,000 E-MAILS, AGAIN, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. WHAT YOU DID. THIS IS AFTER GETTING A SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. >> WE THAT HAVE TOO MOVE ON SECRETARY CLIP TON WE CAN RESPOND -- >> WE WANT TO GIVE THE AUDIENCE >> POCK, DONALD. I KNOW YOU'RE IN TO BIG DIVERSION TONIGHT, ANYTHING TO >> THE QUESTION HERE FROM KEN KARPOWICZ, A QUESTION ABOUT HEALTH CARE. >> ANDERSON WHY AREN'T YOU COSTS DOWN AND MAKE COVERAGE BETTER. >> THAT FIRST ONE GOES TO SECRETARY CLINTON YOU STARTED OUT WITH THE LAST ONE TO THE SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BEFORE. SO, I WANT VERY MUCH TO SAVE WHAT WORKS AND IS GOOD ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET COSTS DOWN. WE'VE GOT TO PROVIDE SOME ELSE. OUTSIDE OF DEFENSE. OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER. YOU KNOW IT, WE ALL KNOW IT. IT'S CATASTROPHIC IN CERTAIN WAYS. BUT SHE WANTS TO GO TO SINGLE PAYER. WHICH MEANS THE GOVERNMENT BASICALLY RULES EVERYTHING. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN AFTER WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT, WE CAN BE VERY POLITICALLY CORRECT, BUT WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT THERE IS A PROBLEM. AND WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT MUSLIMS COME IN AND REPORT WHEN THAT'S WHAT WE WANT AMERICA TO BE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR COOPERATE WITH THE AMERICANS AND THIS IS A GIFT TO ISIS AND THE >> FIRST OF ALL CAPTAIN KAHN IS AN AMERICAN HERO. AND IF I WERE PRESIDENT AT THAT TIME HE WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. BECAUSE UNLIKE HER WHO VOTED FOR THE WAR WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SHE SHE WANTS AMNESTY FOR EVERYBODY, COME RIGHT IN, COME RIGHT OVER. IT'S A HORRIBLE THING SHE'S AMENDMENT. IT WAS PRINCIPLED, IT WAS STRATEGIC. AND I WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT IT IS HARD SOMETIMES TO GET THE CONGRESS TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT AND, YES, PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE SOME PEOPLE HE USED SOME ARGUMENTS, CONVINCING OTHER PEOPLE, HE USED OTHER ARGUMENTS, AT IT AND, YES, PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE SOME PEOPLE HE USED SOME ARGUMENTS, CONVINCING OTHER PEOPLE, HE USED OTHER ARGUMENTS, PROVISIONS, PEOPLE LIKE ME, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I GIVE UP SHE NEVER WILL CHANGE. WE'RE GETTING RID OF CARRIED INTEREST PROVISIONS. I'M LOWERING TAXES ACTUALLY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR CORPORATIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE CORPORATIONS LEADING MASSIVE CORPORATIONS AND I WILL TELL YOU HILLARY CLINTON IS RAISING YOUR TAXES, FOLKS, YOU CAN LOOK AT ME, SHE'S MAYBE 20 YEARS TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO. BUT I'LL TELL WHAT YOU HE'S GOING TO DO. HIS PLAN WILL GIVE THE WEALTHY CORPORATIONS, THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS THEY HAVE EVER HAD. MORE THAN THE BUSH TAX CUTS BY AT LEAST A FACTOR OF TWO. AT LEAST A FACTOR OF TWO. DONALD ALWAYS TAKES CARE OF DONALD AND PEOPLE LIKE DONALD AND THIS WOULD BE A MASSIVE GIFT. INDEED THE WAY THAT HE TALKS ABOUT HIS TAX CUTS WOULD END UP RAISING TAXES ON MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES, MILLIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. I HAVE SAID NOBODY WHO MAKES LESS THAN $250,000 A YEAR, THAT'S THE VAST MAJORITY OF VOTE TO CLOSE CORPORATE LOOPHOLES. VOTED TO CLOSE ONE OF THE LOOPHOLES HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF WHEN HE CLAIMED BILLION DOLLAR LOSS THAT ENABLED HIM TO AVOID TAKING PASSIONS. I WANT TO HAVE A TAX ON PEOPLE ONLY ON TAXES, SHE'S MADE BAD JUDGMENTS ON LIBYA. ON SYRIA, ON IRAQ. I MEAN HER AND OBAMA WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, THE WAY THEY GOT OUTED OF IRAQ, VACUUM THEY LEFT, THAT'S WHY ISIS FORMED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY STARTED FROM THAT LITTLE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TOO, IT'S NOT ME. I'VE STOOD UP TO RUSSIA, I'VE THE RUSSIANS, TRY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. >> THANK YOU SECRETARY -- WHILE SHE'S THERE AS SECRETARY OF STATE WITH THE SO-CALLED LINE IN THE SAND. WHICH -- >> NO, I WASN'T. I HATE TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT AT SOME -- >> WE NEED DO SOME FACT CHECKING. >> YOU WERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, PERHAPS SAD LEO BAMA PROBABLY -- I DON'T THINK HE'D BEEN LISTENING VERY MUCH ANY MORE. THAT WAS THE LINE. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN WITH ALEPPO FALLS? >> I THINK IT'S A -- WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPEN IF IT FALLS? >> BASICALLY HAS FALLEN, OKAY? IT BASICALLY HAS FALLEN. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU TAKE A LOOK AT MOSUL, BIGGEST HAD A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. PEOPLE LEAVE. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO SHAY WE'RE GOING TO BE ATTACKING MOSUL WITHIN THE NEXT FOUR TO SIX WEEKS. WHICH IS WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. HOW STUPID IS OUR COUNTRY? >> THERE ARE SOMETIMES REASONS THE MILITARY DOES THAT. PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE. >> I DON'T THINK OF ANY. >> IT MIGHT BE THE HELP GET CIVILIANS OUT. >> WE HAVE -- I HAVE 200 NO-FLY ZONE AGAINST ASSAD REGIME TO BACK UP DIPLOMACY? HIS CHILDREN ARE INCREDIBLY ABLE AND DEVOTED AND I THINK THAT HE SAYS A LOT ABOUT DONALD. I WILL SAY THIS ABOUT HILLARY. SHE DOESN'T QUIT, SHE DOESN'T >> THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. THE LAST PRESIDENT FALL DEBATE COULD HAVE BEEN -- RATED AS MA MATURE AUDIENCES PER TV PARENTAL GUIDELINES. AND DONE IN THIS CAMPAIGN. AND I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE CLEAR TO OUR THAT. I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING SHE SAID. I BEGAN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONCEMENT. >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN. NO ONE HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO. >> YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEVER DID THAT? >> FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS. THEY ARE SAID. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT. I THINK THE ONE THAT SHOULD YOU REALLY BE APOLOGIZING FOR, THE THING YOU SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING FOR ARE THE 33,000 E-MAILS THAT I'M GOING TO SAY IT. I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU GET A SUBPOENA, AND AFTER LOOK INTO IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN -- THEIR I SAID 11 YEARS AGO, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND I THINK SHE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF, IF COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE.

AS FAR AS OTHER ELEMENTS OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING, I DON'T KNOW PUTIN. I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE GOT ALONG WITH RUSSIA BECAUSE WE COULD FIGHT ISIS TOGETHER AS AN EXAMPLE. BUT I DON'T KNOW PUTIN, BUT I NOTICE ANY TIME ANYTHING WRONG HAPPENS THEY LIKE TO SAY, THE RUSSIANS -- HERE IS THE RUSSIANS DOING THE HACKING, MAYBE THERE IS NO HACKING. BUT THEY ALWAYS BLAME RUSSIA THE REASON THEY BLAME RUSSIA BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO TARNISH ME WITH PUSH A. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT RUSH A. I KNOW AGO, BY THE WAY, SHE'S THAT UNITED STATES -- WAS UNITED STATES SENATOR, SHE COMPLAINS THAT DONALD TRUMP TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE TAX CODE. WELL, WHY DIDN'T SHE CHANGE IT? YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED THOUGH SIMPLE QUESTION, DID YOU USE THAT $ED 60 MILLION LOSS TO LEAVING, VERY INTERESTING WHY SHE'S LEAVING CARRIED INTEREST. I'LL TELL THAT YOU NUMBER ONE I PAY TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF TAXES. I ABSOLUTELY USED IT. SO DID WARREN BUFFETT AND GEORGE SOROS MANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HILLARY IS GETTING MONEY FROM. NOW, I WON'T MENTION THEIR NAMES BECAUSE THEY'RE RICH BUT NOT FAMOUS. FOR 30 YEARS I'VE PRODUCED RESULTS. >> THANK YOU, SECRETARY. >> WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO SYRIA. BOTH OF YOU MENTIONED THAT -- >> I ANY WE SHOULD -- NO, MR. TRUMP WE'RE GOING TO WE HAVE TO WORK WITH OUR ALLIES ON THE GROUND. BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE IS THE AMBITIONS AND AGGRESSIVENESS OF RUSSIA. RUSSIA HAS DECIDED THAT IT'S ALL IN IN SYRIA. CRIMES COMMITTED BY SYRIANS AND THE RUSSIANS, TRY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. >> THANK YOU SECRETARY -- WHILE SHE'S THERE AS SECRETARY OF STATE WITH THE SO-CALLED LINE IN THE SAND. WHICH -- >> NO, I WASN'T. >> MR. TRUMP -- YOUR TWO MINUTES IS UP. >> I DON'T LIKE ASSAD AT ALL. BUT ASSAD IS KILLING ISIS. HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN ALEPPO I WANT TO REMIND YOU WHAT YOUR RUNNING MATE SAID. PROVOCATIONS BY RUSSIA NEED TO BE MET WITH AMERICAN STRENGTH THAT IF RUSSIA CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN AIRSTRIKES ALONG WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES OF ASSAD, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE PREPARED TO USE MILITARY FORCE GROUND FORCES IN SYRIA. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE. I DON'T THINK AMERICAN TROOPS SHOULD BE HOLDING TERRITORY, PUSHING ISIS. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL MOVE ON -- >> SHE WEPT OVER A MINUTE OVER AND YOU DON'T STOP HER. WITH INNER CITIES, BIGGEST IN 45 YEARS. WE HAVE A DIVIDED NATION, BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE HER, BELIEVE FAIR AND IMPORTANT QUESTION. I RESPECT HIS CHILDREN. HIS CHILDREN ARE INCREDIBLY ABLE AND DEVOTED AND I THINK THAT HE SAYS A LOT ABOUT DONALD. I DON'T AGREE WITH NEARLY ANYTHING ELSE HE SAYS OR DOES. WONDERFUL KIDS. I CONSIDER THAT A COMPLIMENT. I WILL SAY THIS ABOUT HILLARY. SHE DOESN'T QUIT, SHE DOESN'T GIVE UP. I RESPECT THAT. I TELL IT LIKE IT IS. SHE'S A FIGHTER. I DISAGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT SHE'S FIGHTING FOR. I DID DISAGREE WITH HER JUDGMENT YOU SAID LOCKER ROOM BANTER, KISSING WOMEN WITHOUT CONSTENT, GRABBING THEIR GENITALS THAT IS SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU DRAGGED THAT YOU HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK. WHEN WE HAVE A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE ISIS CHOPPING OFF HEADS, WHERE YOU HAVE -- FRANKLY DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES WHERE YOU HAVE WARS AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SITES ALL OVER, WHERE YOU HAVE SO MANY BAD THINGS HAPPENING, THIS IS LIKE MEDIEVAL TIMES, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THE CARNAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND THEY LOOK AND THEY SEE, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRANKLY DOING SO WELL AGAINST US WITH ISIS. AND THEY LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY THEY SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. YES, I'M VERY EMBARRASSED BY IT. I HATE IT. BUT IT'S LOCKER ROOM TALK. AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS, I WILL KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS. WE'RE GOING TO DEFEAT ISIS. >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. THINGS AND MUCH BIGGER THINGS. >> JUST FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO THAT DID YOU NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONCEMENT. >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN. NO ONE HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO. >> YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEVER DID THAT? >> FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS. THEY ARE SAID. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT. BUT I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR WOMEN. >> HAVE YOU EVER DONE -- PERSONAL TERM. SO, YES, THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP S. BUT IT'S NOT ONLY WOMEN AND IT'S NOT ONLY THIS VIDEO THAT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FITNESS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE HE HAS ALSO TARGETED IMMIGRANTS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, LATINOS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, P.O.W.s, MUSLIMS, SO MANY OTHERS. SO THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. THE QUESTION FOR US, THE QUESTION OUR COUNTRY MUST ANSWER IS, THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT'S WHY TO GO BACK TO YOUR QUESTION, I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE, WE ALL SHOULD, TO EVERY BOY AND GIRL AND DEED TO THE I AM A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS NATION THAT HAS BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT HIM OFF AND SHE SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, LAUGHING AT THE GIRL WHO WAS RAPED. KATHY SHELTON, THAT YOUNG WOMAN, IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT. SO, DON'T TELL ME ABOUT WORDS. I AM ABSOLUTELY, I APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAY. BUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID, HE WAS IMPEACHED, HE LOST HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. HE HAD TO PAY AN $850,000 FINE TO ONE OF THE WOMEN. PAULA JONES, WHO IS ALSO HERE TONIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S GETS TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN ANYWAY HE CHOOSES. GETS TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. INSTEAD OF ANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS, TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENDA, LAYING OUT THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE THINKING MAKE A BETTER LIFE AND A BETTER COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I DIDN'T THINK I'D SAY THIS BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT. I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU GET A SUBPOENA, AND AFTER GETTING THE SUBPOENA, YOU DELETE THEN YOU AS IT WASH THEM OR BLEACH THEM AS YOU WOULD SAY, VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS.

IT WAS PRINCIPLED, IT WAS STRATEGIC. AND I WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT IT IS HARD SOMETIMES TO GET THE CONGRESS TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT AND, YES, PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED. NOW SHE'S BLAMING THE LIE ON THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN THAT'S ONE THAT I HAVEN'T -- SIMPLE QUESTION, DID YOU USE THAT $ED 60 MILLION LOSS TO TO STRIKE THE MILITARY TARGETS OF THE ASSAD REGIME. I RESPECT HIS CHILDREN. I RESPECT HIS CHILDREN. HIS CHILDREN ARE INCREDIBLY ABLE AND DEVOTED AND I THINK THAT HE SAYS A LOT ABOUT DONALD. I WILL SAY THIS ABOUT HILLARY.

I WILL TELL YOU HILLARY CLINTON IS RAISING YOUR TAXES, FOLKS, YOU CAN LOOK AT ME, SHE'S DIFFERENCE. WE ARE GOING TO BE THRIVING AGAIN. WE HAVE NO GROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY, THERE'S NO GROWTH. IF CHINA HAS A GDP OF 7%, IT'S LIKE NATIONAL CATASTROPHE. WE'RE DOWN TO 1%. AND THAT'S LIKE NO GROWTH. WE'RE GOING LOWER. IN MY OPINION. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT OUR TAXES ARE SO HIGH. JUST ABOUT THE HIGHEST IN THE TOP. AND WE NEED TO REVERSE. THAT PEOPLE LIKE DONALD WHO PAY ZERO IN TAXES, ZERO FOR OUR VETS, ZERO FOR OUR MILITARY, ZERO FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION, THAT IS WRONG.

PROVOCATIONS BY RUSSIA NEED TO BE MET WITH AMERICAN STRENGTH THAT IF RUSSIA CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN AIRSTRIKES ALONG WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES OF ASSAD, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE PREPARED TO USE MILITARY FORCE TO STRIKE THE MILITARY TARGETS OF THE ASSAD REGIME. >> OKAY. HE AND I HAVEN'T SPOKEN I DISAGREE. YOU. DISAGREE WITH YOUR RUNNING MATE. >> RIGHT NOW, SYRIA IS FIGHTING ISIS WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO FIGHT BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. SHE HAD CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING WITH SYRIA, THEY HAD A CHANCE. THAT WAS THE LINE. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN WITH ALEPPO FALLS? WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONCEMENT. >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN.

BECAUSE HE HAS ALSO TARGETED IMMIGRANTS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT NATION THAT HAS BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS. SO, WE'RE GOING TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN -- THEIR BETTER FOR PEOPLE. SO, ONCE AGAIN, GO TO BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP >> SECRETARY CLINTON YOU YOU CAN RESPOND WE HAVE TO MOVE ON TO AUDIENCE QUESTION. >> LOOK, IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS NATION THAT HAS BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON ON WITH THE DEVIL. BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT APOLOGY, I THINK THE ONE THAT SHOULD YOU REALLY BE APOLOGIZING FOR, THE THING YOU SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING FOR ARE THE 33,000 E-MAILS THAT YOU DELETED AND THAT YOU ACID WASHED THEN THE TWO BOXES OF E-MAILS AND OTHER THINGS LAST WEEK THAT WERE TAKEN FROM AN OFFICE AND ARE NOW MISSING. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I DIDN'T THINK I'D SAY THIS BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT. I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK GET A SUBPOENA, AND AFTER GETTING THE SUBPOENA, YOU DELETE LIVES HAVE BEEN DETRIED FOR DOING ONE FIFTH OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. IT'S A DISGRACE. YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED.

PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY LIKE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE, WHERE THEY ARE FROM, WHAT THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT OUR BOMBED BY THE RUSSIANS AND SYRIAN AIR FORCES. THERE ARE CHILDREN SUFFERING IN THIS CATASTROPHIC WAR, LARGELY I BELIEVE BECAUSE OF RUSSIAN AGGRESSION. AND WE NEED TO DO OUR PART. THE RUSSIANS, TRY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. >> THANK YOU SECRETARY -- WHILE SHE'S THERE AS SECRETARY OF STATE WITH THE SO-CALLED LINE IN THE SAND. GIRL SCOUT. SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHEN SHE SAID AT BENGHAZI. SHE SAID WHO IS GOING TO ANSWER THE CALL AT 3:00. GUESS WHAT.

JUST 48 HOURS IT'S BECOME THE SINGLE MOST TALKED ABOUT STORY OF THE ENTIRE 2016 ELECTION ON FACEBOOK. WITH MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DISCUSSING IT ON THE SOCIAL NETWORK. AS WE SAID A MOMENT AGO WE DO WANT TO BRING IN QUESTIONS FROM VOTERS AROUND THE COUNTRY VIA SOCIAL MEDIA OUR FIRST ON THIS TOPIC, JEFF FROM OHIO, ASKS ON FACEBOOK.

BECAUSE HE HAS ALSO TARGETED IMMIGRANTS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, LATINOS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, P.O.W.s, MUSLIMS, SO MANY OTHERS. SO THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. THE QUESTION FOR US, THE LOOK INTO IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN -- THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN DETRIED FOR DOING ONE FIFTH OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. IT'S A DISGRACE. WHAT, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN -- THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN DETRIED FOR DOING ONE FIFTH OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. IT'S A DISGRACE.

AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR USING A PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT. OBVIOUSLY IF I WERE TO DO IT OVER AGAIN I WOULD NOT. I'M NOT MAKING ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE. I AM VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT WHERE THERE ARE SOME MISLEADING ACCUSATIONS FROM CRITICS AND OTHERS. AFTER A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANYONE HACKED THE SERVER I WAS USING. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY ONE CAN POINTED TO, AT ALL, ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE HAS NO BASIS, THAT ANY CLASSIFIED MATERIAL ENDED UP IN THE WRONG HANDS. I TAKE CLASSIFIED MATERIAL VERY SERIOUSLY. AND ALWAYS HAVE WHEN I WAS ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, I WAS PRIVY TO A LOT OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL. OBVIOUSLY AS SECRETARY OF STATE, TRUMP S. BUT IT'S NOT ONLY WOMEN AND IT'S NOT ONLY THIS VIDEO THAT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FITNESS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE HE HAS ALSO TARGETED IMMIGRANTS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, LATINOS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, P.O.W.s, MUSLIMS, SO MANY OTHERS. SO THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS.

IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU DONE. IT'S A DISGRACE. YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED. IN THE FIRST DEBATE -- >> THE AUDIENCE NEEDS TO CALL DOWN HERE. >> -- WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FACT CHECKING DONALD ALL THE TIME. I'D NEVER GET TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT TO DO, HOW WE'RE GOING TO REALLY MAKE LIVES BETTER FOR PEOPLE. SO, ONCE AGAIN, GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM WE HAVE LITERALLY, YOU CAN FACT CHECK HIM IN REALTIME. LAST TIME THE FIRST DEBATE WE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FACT CHECKING SO I EXPECTS WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP DONE. IT'S A DISGRACE. YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED.

LAST TIME THE FIRST DEBATE WE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FACT CHECKING SO I EXPECTS WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP EXCERPTS OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S PAID SPEECHES WHICH SHE HAS REFUSED TO RELEASE. ONE LINE IN PARTICULAR IN WHICH YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON, REPORTEDLY SAID YOU NEED BOTH A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POSITION ON CERTAIN ISSUES. SO, TWO, FROM VIRGINIA, ASKEDS IT OKAY FOR POLITICIANS TO BE TWO-FACED? IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A PRIVATE STANCE ON ISSUES. SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, RIGHT, AS I RECALL THAT WAS SOMETHING I SAID ABOUT HACKING ON AMERICAN ACCOUNTS TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. AND WIKILEAKS IS PART OF THAT, AS ARE OTHER SITES WHERE THE RUSSIANS HACK INFORMATION, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S ACCURATE INFORMATION, THEN THEY PUT IT OUT. WE HAVE NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE AN ADVERSARY, A FOREIGN POWER, IS WORKING SO HARD TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. AND BELIEVE ME, THEY'RE NOT DOING IT TO GET ME ELECTED. THEY'RE DOING IT TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION FOR DONALD TRUMP. NOW, MAYBE BECAUSE HE HAS PRAISED PUTIN, MAYBE BECAUSE HE SAYS HE AGREES WITH A LOT OF WHAT PUTIN WANTS TO DO, MAYBE BECAUSE HE WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN MOSCOW, I DON'T KNOW THE REASONS. BUT WE DESERVE ANSWERS. AND WE SHOULD DEMAND THAT DONALD RELEASE ALL OF HIS TAX RETURNS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT ARE LOSS THAT ENABLED HIM TO AVOID TAKING PASSIONS. I WANT TO HAVE A TAX ON PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS, IT'S CALLED THE BUFFETT, HE'S GONE OUT SAID, SOMEBODY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY. I WANT TO HAVE A SURCHARGE ON INCOMES ABOVE $5 MILLION. WE HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO IN SPREES IN YOU. I WANT TO INVEST IN HARD WORKING FAMILIES. I THINK IT'S BEEN UNFORTUNATE BUT IT'S HAPPENED. THAT SINCE THE GREAT RESECTION THE GAINS HAVE ALL GONE TO THE TOP. AND WE NEED TO REVERSE. THAT PEOPLE LIKE DONALD WHO PAY ZERO IN TAXES, ZERO FOR OUR VETS, ZERO FOR OUR MILITARY, ZERO FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION, THAT IS WRONG. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY, NO CORPORATION, AND NO INDIVIDUAL CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT PAYING HIS FAIR SHARE. >> THANK YOU. MR. TRUMP GIVE CHANCE TO RESPOND JUST TELL OUR VIEWERS WHAT SHE'S REFERRING TO. LAST MONTH TAXES WERE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE ON FACEBOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE CAMPAIGN. \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PUBLISHED THREE PAGES OF YOUR 1995 TAX RETURN, SHOW YOU CLAIMED $960 MILLION LOSS. WHICH MEANS YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED PAYING PERSONAL FEDERAL INCOME TAXES FOR YEARS, WE'VE SAID YOU PAY STATE TAXES, REAL ESTATE TAXES, PROPERTY TAXES, YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED THOUGH SIMPLE QUESTION, DID YOU USE THAT $ED 60 MILLION LOSS TO AVOID PAYING PERSONAL FED RAM INCOME TAX. >> OF COURSE I DO. SO DO ALL OF HER DONORS OR MOST OF HER DONORS. I KNOW MANY OF HER DONORS. THEY TOOK MASSIVE TAX WRITE-OFFS. >> HAVE YOU -- LOT OF MY WRITE OFF WAS DEPRECIATION AND OTHER THINGS THAT HILLARY AS SENATOR ALLOWED. SHE'LL ALWAYS ALLOW PEOPLE THAT GIVE HER ALL THIS MONEY THEY WANT IT. THAT'S WHY. SEE I UNDERSTAND THE TAX CODE BETTER THAN ANYBODY THAT'S EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HILLARY CLINTON AND IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLEX, HILLARY CLINTON HAS FRIENDS THAT WANT ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDING THEY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO WALL STREET PEOPLE. BUT THEY REALLY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION. WHICH I BELIEVE HILLARY'S LEAVING, VERY INTERESTING WHY SHE'S LEAVING CARRIED INTEREST. I'LL TELL THAT YOU NUMBER ONE I PAY TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF TAXES. I ABSOLUTELY USED IT. SO DID WARREN BUFFETT AND GEORGE SOROS MANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HILLARY IS GETTING MONEY WHO ARE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS, IT'S CALLED THE BUFFETT, HE'S GONE OUT SAID, SOMEBODY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY. I WANT TO HAVE A SURCHARGE ON INCOMES ABOVE $5 MILLION. WE HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO IN SPREES IN YOU. I WANT TO INVEST IN HARD WORKING FAMILIES.

NOW, I WON'T MENTION THEIR NAMES THING. WHAT WE ALL SAW AND HEARD ON FRIDAY WAS DONALD TALKING ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE DOES TO WOMEN. AND HE HAS SAID THAT THE VIDEO DOESN'T REPRESENT WHO HE IS. BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR TO ANYONE WHO HEARD IT THAT IT REPRESENTS EXACTLY WHO HE IS. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE SEEN HIM INSULT WOMEN. WE HAVE SEEN HIM RATE WOMEN ON THEIR APPEARANCE, RANKING THEM I AM A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY.

BUT WE ARE PUTTING OUR ENERGY COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS. WE HAVE TO BRING BACK OUR WORKERS. YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO STEEL AND THE COST OF STEEL AND CHINA DUMPING VAST AMOUNTS OF STEEL ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS KILLING OUR STEELWORKERS AND OUR STEEL COMPANIES. GRABBING THEIR GENITALS THAT IS SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU DRAGGED THAT YOU HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL.

I KNOW YOU'RE IN TO BIG DIVERSION TONIGHT, ANYTHING TO THAT $ED 60 MILLION LOSS TO FAIR AND IMPORTANT QUESTION. I RESPECT HIS CHILDREN. WONDERFUL KIDS. I CONSIDER THAT A COMPLIMENT. I WILL SAY THIS ABOUT HILLARY. GRABBING THEIR GENITALS THAT IS THINGS. THEY ARE SAID. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST HACKED THE SERVER I WAS USING.

YOU KNOW, WITH PRIOR REPUBLICAN NOMINEES FOR PRESIDENT, I DISAGREED WITH THEM. ON POLITICS, POLICIES, PRINCIPLE, BUT I NEVER QUESTIONED THEIR FITNESS TO SERVE. DONALD TRUMP IS DIFFERENT. I SAID STARTING BACK IN JUNE THAT HE WAS NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF. AND MANY REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS HAVE SAID THE SAME THING. WHAT WE ALL SAW AND HEARD ON FRIDAY WAS DONALD TALKING ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE DOES TO WOMEN. AND HE HAS SAID THAT THE VIDEO DOESN'T REPRESENT WHO HE IS. THINGS AND MUCH BIGGER THINGS. >> JUST FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO THAT DID YOU NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONCEMENT. >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN.

WHAT WE ALL SAW AND HEARD ON FRIDAY WAS DONALD TALKING ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE DOES TO WOMEN. AND HE HAS SAID THAT THE VIDEO DOESN'T REPRESENT WHO HE IS. AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES -- >> AS I TOLD THAT YOU WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I AM NOT PROUD OF IT. I AM A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS NATION THAT HAS BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT ROOM TALK. I AM NOT PROUD OF IT. I AM A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS NATION THAT HAS BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT HIM OFF AND SHE SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, LAUGHING AT THE GIRL WHO WAS RAPED. KATHY SHELTON, THAT YOUNG WOMAN, IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT. SO, DON'T TELL ME ABOUT WORDS. I AM ABSOLUTELY, I APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAY. BUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID, HE WAS IMPEACHED, HE LOST HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. HE HAD TO PAY AN $850,000 FINE TO ONE OF THE WOMEN. PAULA JONES, WHO IS ALSO HERE TONIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN HILLARY BRINGS UP A POINT LIKE THAT SHE TALKS ABOUT WORDS THAT I SAID 11 YEARS AGO, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND I THINK SHE SAYING, SO MUCH OF WHAT HE'S JUST SAID IS NOT RIGHT BUT HE GETS TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN ANYWAY HE CHOOSES. GETS TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. INSTEAD OF ANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS, TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENDA, LAYING OUT THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE THINKING MAKE A BETTER LIFE AND A BETTER COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, MICHELLE OBAMA ADVISED US ALL. WHEN THEY GO LOW, YOU GO HIGH. [ Applause ] AND, LOOK, IF THIS WERE JUST ABOUT ONE VIDEO, MAYBE WHAT HE'S SAYING TONIGHT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT EVERYONE CAN DRAW THEIR OWN SAYING, SO MUCH OF WHAT HE'S JUST SAID IS NOT RIGHT BUT HE GETS TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN ANYWAY HE CHOOSES. GETS TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. INSTEAD OF ANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS, TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENDA, LAYING OUT THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE THINKING MAKE A BETTER LIFE AND A BETTER COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, MICHELLE OBAMA ADVISED US ALL. WHEN THEY GO LOW, YOU GO HIGH. [ Applause ] AND, LOOK, IF THIS WERE JUST ABOUT ONE VIDEO, MAYBE WHAT HE'S SAYING TONIGHT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT EVERYONE CAN DRAW THEIR OWN I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS.

THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU DONE. IT'S A DISGRACE. YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED. IN THE FIRST DEBATE -- >> THE AUDIENCE NEEDS TO CALL DOWN HERE. >> -- WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FACT CHECKING DONALD ALL THE TIME. I'D NEVER GET TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT TO DO, HOW WE'RE GOING TO REALLY MAKE LIVES BETTER FOR PEOPLE. SO, ONCE AGAIN, GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM WE HAVE LITERALLY, YOU CAN FACT CHECK HIM IN REALTIME. LAST TIME THE FIRST DEBATE WE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FACT CHECKING SO I EXPECTS WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST DONE. IT'S A DISGRACE. YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED. IN THE FIRST DEBATE -- >> THE AUDIENCE NEEDS TO CALL DOWN HERE. >> -- WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FACT CHECKING DONALD ALL THE TIME. I'D NEVER GET TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT TO DO, HOW WE'RE GOING TO REALLY MAKE LIVES BETTER FOR PEOPLE. SO, ONCE AGAIN, GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM WE HAVE LITERALLY, YOU CAN FACT CHECK HIM IN REALTIME. LAST TIME THE FIRST DEBATE WE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FACT VOTES. THIS QUESTION INVOLVES WIKILEAKSS RELEASED SUPPORT EXCERPTS OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S PAID SPEECHES WHICH SHE HAS REFUSED TO RELEASE. ONE LINE IN PARTICULAR IN WHICH YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON, REPORTEDLY SAID YOU NEED BOTH A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POSITION ON CERTAIN ISSUES. SO, TWO, FROM VIRGINIA, ASKEDS IT OKAY FOR POLITICIANS TO BE TWO-FACED? IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A PRIVATE STANCE ON ISSUES. SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, RIGHT, AS I RECALL THAT WAS SOMETHING I SAID ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN AFTER HAVING SEEN THE WONDERFUL STEVEN SPIELBERG MOVIE CALLED \"LINCOLN.\" IT WAS A MASTER CLASS WATCHING PRESIDENT LINCOLN GET THE CONGRESS TO APPROVE THE 13th AMENDMENT. IT WAS PRINCIPLED, IT WAS STRATEGIC. AND I WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT IT IS HARD SOMETIMES TO GET THE CONGRESS TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT AND, YES, PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE SOME PEOPLE HE USED SOME ARGUMENTS, CONVINCING OTHER PEOPLE, HE USED OTHER ARGUMENTS, THAT WAS A GREAT -- I THOUGHT A GREAT DISPLAY OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. BUT, YOU KNOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE, MARTHA, BECAUSE OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY JUST CAME OUT AND SAID IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, THAT THE KREMLIN, MEANING PUTIN AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, ARE DIRECTING THE ATTACKS, THE HACKING ON AMERICAN ACCOUNTS TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. AND WIKILEAKS IS PART OF THAT, AS ARE OTHER SITES WHERE THE RUSSIANS HACK INFORMATION, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S ACCURATE INFORMATION, THEN THEY PUT IT OUT. WE HAVE NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE AN ADVERSARY, A FOREIGN POWER, IS WORKING SO HARD TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. AND BELIEVE ME, THEY'RE NOT DOING IT TO GET ME ELECTED. THEY'RE DOING IT TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION FOR DONALD TRUMP. NOW, MAYBE BECAUSE HE HAS PRAISED PUTIN, MAYBE BECAUSE HE SAYS HE AGREES WITH A LOT OF WHAT PUTIN WANTS TO DO, MAYBE BECAUSE HE WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN MOSCOW, I DON'T KNOW THE REASONS. BUT WE DESERVE ANSWERS. AND WE SHOULD DEMAND THAT DONALD RELEASE ALL OF HIS TAX RETURNS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT ARE THE INTANGLEMENTS AND -- >> WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER. SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU'RE OUT OF TIME. >> I THINK SHY RESPOND BECAUSE -- SHY RESPOND SO RIDICULOUS. NOW SHE'S BLAMING -- SHE GOT CAUGHT IN A TOTAL LIE. HER PAPERS WENT OUT TO ALL HER FRIENDS AT THE BANK, GOLDMAN SACHS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. AND SHE SAID THINGS WIKILEAKS THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED. NOW SHE'S BLAMING THE LIE ON THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN EXCERPTS OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S PAID SPEECHES WHICH SHE HAS REFUSED TO RELEASE. ONE LINE IN PARTICULAR IN WHICH YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON, PRIVATE STANCE ON ISSUES. SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, RIGHT, AS I RECALL THAT WAS SOMETHING I SAID ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN AFTER HAVING SEEN THE WONDERFUL STEVEN SPIELBERG MOVIE CALLED \"LINCOLN.\" IT WAS A MASTER CLASS WATCHING PRESIDENT LINCOLN GET THE CONGRESS TO APPROVE THE 13th AMENDMENT.

HER PAPERS WENT OUT TO ALL HER FRIENDS AT THE BANK, GOLDMAN SACHS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. AND SHE SAID THINGS WIKILEAKS THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED. NOW SHE'S BLAMING THE LIE ON THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN LOSS THAT ENABLED HIM TO AVOID TAKING PASSIONS. I WANT TO HAVE A TAX ON PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS, IT'S CALLED THE BUFFETT, HE'S GONE OUT SAID, SOMEBODY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY. I WANT TO HAVE A SURCHARGE ON INCOMES ABOVE $5 MILLION. WE HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO IN SPREES IN YOU. I WANT TO INVEST IN HARD WORKING FAMILIES. I THINK IT'S BEEN UNFORTUNATE BUT IT'S HAPPENED. THAT SINCE THE GREAT RESECTION THE GAINS HAVE ALL GONE TO THE TOP. AND WE NEED TO REVERSE. THAT PEOPLE LIKE DONALD WHO PAY ZERO IN TAXES, ZERO FOR OUR VETS, ZERO FOR OUR MILITARY, ZERO FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION, THAT IS WRONG. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY, NO CORPORATION, AND NO INDIVIDUAL CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT PAYING HIS FAIR SHARE. >> THANK YOU. MR. TRUMP GIVE CHANCE TO RESPOND JUST TELL OUR VIEWERS WHAT SHE'S REFERRING TO. LAST MONTH TAXES WERE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE ON FACEBOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE CAMPAIGN. \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PUBLISHED THREE PAGES OF YOUR 1995 TAX RETURN, SHOW YOU CLAIMED $960 MILLION LOSS. WHICH MEANS YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED PAYING PERSONAL FEDERAL INCOME TAXES FOR YEARS, WE'VE SAID YOU PAY STATE TAXES, REAL ESTATE TAXES, PROPERTY TAXES, YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED THOUGH SIMPLE QUESTION, DID YOU USE THAT $ED 60 MILLION LOSS TO AVOID PAYING PERSONAL FED RAM INCOME TAX. >> OF COURSE I DO. SO DO ALL OF HER DONORS OR MOST OF HER DONORS. I KNOW MANY OF HER DONORS. THEY TOOK MASSIVE TAX WRITE-OFFS. >> HAVE YOU -- LOT OF MY WRITE OFF WAS DEPRECIATION AND OTHER THINGS THAT HILLARY AS SENATOR ALLOWED. SHE'LL ALWAYS ALLOW PEOPLE THAT GIVE HER ALL THIS MONEY THEY WANT IT. THAT'S WHY. SEE I UNDERSTAND THE TAX CODE BETTER THAN ANYBODY THAT'S EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HILLARY CLINTON AND IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLEX, HILLARY CLINTON HAS FRIENDS THAT WANT ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDING THEY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO WALL STREET PEOPLE. BUT THEY REALLY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION. WHICH I BELIEVE HILLARY'S LEAVING, VERY INTERESTING WHY SHE'S LEAVING CARRIED INTEREST. I'LL TELL THAT YOU NUMBER ONE I PAY TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF TAXES. I ABSOLUTELY USED IT. SO DID WARREN BUFFETT AND GEORGE SOROS MANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HILLARY IS GETTING MONEY FROM. NOW, I WON'T MENTION THEIR NAMES BECAUSE THEY'RE RICH BUT NOT FAMOUS. WE WON'T MAKE THEM FAMOUS. >> CAN YOU SAY HOW MANY YEARS TAKING PASSIONS.

SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, I'M GOING TO SAY IT. I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP RHETORIC, WOULD EITHER OF YOU NAME ONE POSITIVE THING THAT YOU I RESPECT HIS CHILDREN. THINGS AND MUCH BIGGER THINGS. >> JUST FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO THAT DID YOU NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONCEMENT. >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN. NO ONE HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO. >> YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEVER DID THAT? >> FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS. THEY ARE SAID. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT.

WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND WEALTHY AGAIN. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, IT JUST -- SOUNDS HARSH TO SAY, BUT WE HAVE TO BUILD UP THE WEALTH OF -- >> THANK YOU, MR. TRUMP. >> THEY'RE TAKING OUR WEALTH THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. >> SECRETARY CLINTON DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND? >> WELL, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING OVER THE LAST 48 HOURS ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD AND SAW. YOU KNOW, WITH PRIOR REPUBLICAN NOMINEES FOR PRESIDENT, I DISAGREED WITH THEM. ON POLITICS, POLICIES, PRINCIPLE, BUT I NEVER QUESTIONED THEIR FITNESS TO SERVE. DONALD TRUMP IS DIFFERENT. I SAID STARTING BACK IN JUNE THAT HE WAS NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF. AND MANY REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS HAVE SAID THE SAME THING. WHAT WE ALL SAW AND HEARD ON FRIDAY WAS DONALD TALKING ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE DOES TO WOMEN. >> AS I TOLD THAT YOU WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I AM NOT PROUD OF IT. I AM A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS NATION THAT HAS BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT HIM OFF AND SHE SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, LAUGHING AT THE GIRL WHO WAS RAPED. KATHY SHELTON, THAT YOUNG WOMAN, IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT. SO, DON'T TELL ME ABOUT WORDS. I AM ABSOLUTELY, I APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAY. BUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID, HE WAS IMPEACHED, HE LOST HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. HE HAD TO PAY AN $850,000 FINE TO ONE OF THE WOMEN. PAULA JONES, WHO IS ALSO HERE TONIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN HILLARY BRINGS UP A POINT LIKE THAT SHE TALKS ABOUT WORDS THAT I SAID 11 YEARS AGO, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND I THINK SHE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. [ Applause ] >> CAN WE PLEASE HOLD THE APPLAUSE? SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. >> WELL, FIRST, LET ME START BY SAYING, SO MUCH OF WHAT HE'S JUST SAID IS NOT RIGHT BUT HE GETS TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN ANYWAY HE CHOOSES. GETS TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. INSTEAD OF ANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS, TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENDA, LAYING OUT THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE THINKING MAKE A BETTER LIFE AND A BETTER COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, MICHELLE OBAMA ADVISED US ALL. WHEN THEY GO LOW, YOU GO HIGH. [ Applause ] AND, LOOK, IF THIS WERE JUST ABOUT ONE VIDEO, MAYBE WHAT HE'S SAYING TONIGHT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT EVERYONE CAN DRAW THEIR OWN I'M GOING TO SAY IT. I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU I HATE TO SAY IT.

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING DONE. IT'S A DISGRACE. YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED. IN THE FIRST DEBATE -- >> THE AUDIENCE NEEDS TO CALL DOWN HERE. >> -- WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FACT CHECKING DONALD ALL THE TIME. I'D NEVER GET TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT TO DO, HOW WE'RE GOING TO REALLY MAKE LIVES BETTER FOR PEOPLE. SO, ONCE AGAIN, GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM WE HAVE LITERALLY, YOU CAN FACT CHECK HIM IN REALTIME. LAST TIME THE FIRST DEBATE WE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FACT CHECKING SO I EXPECTS WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP DONE. IT'S A DISGRACE. YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED.

LAST TIME THE FIRST DEBATE WE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FACT CHECKING SO I EXPECTS WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP VOTES. THIS QUESTION INVOLVES WIKILEAKSS RELEASED SUPPORT EXCERPTS OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S PAID SPEECHES WHICH SHE HAS REFUSED TO RELEASE. ONE LINE IN PARTICULAR IN WHICH YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON, REPORTEDLY SAID YOU NEED BOTH A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POSITION ON CERTAIN ISSUES. SO, TWO, FROM VIRGINIA, ASKEDS IT OKAY FOR POLITICIANS TO BE TWO-FACED? IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A PRIVATE STANCE ON ISSUES. SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, RIGHT, AS I RECALL THAT WAS SOMETHING I SAID ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN AFTER HAVING SEEN THE WONDERFUL STEVEN SPIELBERG MOVIE CALLED \"LINCOLN.\" IT WAS A MASTER CLASS WATCHING PRESIDENT LINCOLN GET THE CONGRESS TO APPROVE THE 13th AMENDMENT. IT WAS PRINCIPLED, IT WAS STRATEGIC. AND I WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT IT IS HARD SOMETIMES TO GET THE CONGRESS TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT AND, YES, PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE SOME PEOPLE HE USED SOME ARGUMENTS, CONVINCING OTHER PEOPLE, HE USED OTHER ARGUMENTS, THAT WAS A GREAT -- I THOUGHT A GREAT DISPLAY OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. BUT, YOU KNOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE, MARTHA, BECAUSE OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY JUST CAME OUT AND SAID IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, THAT THE KREMLIN, MEANING PUTIN AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, ARE DIRECTING THE ATTACKS, THE HACKING ON AMERICAN ACCOUNTS TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. AND WIKILEAKS IS PART OF THAT, AS ARE OTHER SITES WHERE THE RUSSIANS HACK INFORMATION, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S ACCURATE INFORMATION, THEN THEY PUT IT OUT. WE HAVE NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE AN ADVERSARY, A FOREIGN POWER, IS WORKING SO HARD TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. AND BELIEVE ME, THEY'RE NOT DOING IT TO GET ME ELECTED. THEY'RE DOING IT TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION FOR DONALD TRUMP. NOW, MAYBE BECAUSE HE HAS PRAISED PUTIN, MAYBE BECAUSE HE SAYS HE AGREES WITH A LOT OF WHAT PUTIN WANTS TO DO, MAYBE BECAUSE HE WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN MOSCOW, I DON'T KNOW THE REASONS. BUT WE DESERVE ANSWERS. AND WE SHOULD DEMAND THAT DONALD RELEASE ALL OF HIS TAX RETURNS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT ARE THE INTANGLEMENTS AND -- >> WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER. SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU'RE OUT OF TIME. >> I THINK SHY RESPOND BECAUSE -- SHY RESPOND SO RIDICULOUS. NOW SHE'S BLAMING -- SHE GOT CAUGHT IN A TOTAL LIE. HER PAPERS WENT OUT TO ALL HER FRIENDS AT THE BANK, GOLDMAN SACHS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. AND SHE SAID THINGS WIKILEAKS THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED. NOW SHE'S BLAMING THE LIE ON THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN THAT'S ONE THAT I HAVEN'T -- TAKING PASSIONS. I WANT TO HAVE A TAX ON PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS, IT'S CALLED THE BUFFETT, HE'S GONE OUT SAID, SOMEBODY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY. I WANT TO HAVE A SURCHARGE ON INCOMES ABOVE $5 MILLION. WE HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO IN SPREES IN YOU. I WANT TO INVEST IN HARD WORKING FAMILIES. I THINK IT'S BEEN UNFORTUNATE BUT IT'S HAPPENED. THAT SINCE THE GREAT RESECTION THE GAINS HAVE ALL GONE TO THE TOP. AND WE NEED TO REVERSE. THAT PEOPLE LIKE DONALD WHO PAY ZERO IN TAXES, ZERO FOR OUR VETS, ZERO FOR OUR MILITARY, ZERO FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION, THAT IS WRONG. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY, NO CORPORATION, AND NO INDIVIDUAL CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT PAYING HIS FAIR SHARE. >> THANK YOU. MR. TRUMP GIVE CHANCE TO RESPOND JUST TELL OUR VIEWERS WHAT SHE'S REFERRING TO. LAST MONTH TAXES WERE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE ON FACEBOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE CAMPAIGN. \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PUBLISHED THREE PAGES OF YOUR 1995 TAX RETURN, SHOW YOU CLAIMED $960 MILLION LOSS. WHICH MEANS YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED PAYING PERSONAL FEDERAL INCOME TAXES FOR YEARS, WE'VE SAID YOU PAY STATE TAXES, REAL ESTATE TAXES, PROPERTY TAXES, YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED THOUGH SIMPLE QUESTION, DID YOU USE THAT $ED 60 MILLION LOSS TO AVOID PAYING PERSONAL FED RAM INCOME TAX. >> OF COURSE I DO. SO DO ALL OF HER DONORS OR MOST OF HER DONORS. I KNOW MANY OF HER DONORS. THEY TOOK MASSIVE TAX WRITE-OFFS. >> HAVE YOU -- LOT OF MY WRITE OFF WAS DEPRECIATION AND OTHER THINGS THAT HILLARY AS SENATOR ALLOWED. SHE'LL ALWAYS ALLOW PEOPLE THAT GIVE HER ALL THIS MONEY THEY WANT IT. THAT'S WHY. SEE I UNDERSTAND THE TAX CODE BETTER THAN ANYBODY THAT'S EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HILLARY CLINTON AND IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLEX, HILLARY CLINTON HAS FRIENDS THAT WANT ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDING THEY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO WALL STREET PEOPLE. BUT THEY REALLY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION. WHICH I BELIEVE HILLARY'S LEAVING, VERY INTERESTING WHY SHE'S LEAVING CARRIED INTEREST. I'LL TELL THAT YOU NUMBER ONE I PAY TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF TAXES. I ABSOLUTELY USED IT. SO DID WARREN BUFFETT AND GEORGE SOROS MANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HILLARY IS GETTING MONEY FROM. NOW, I WON'T MENTION THEIR NAMES BECAUSE THEY'RE RICH BUT NOT WHO ARE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS, IT'S CALLED THE BUFFETT, HE'S GONE OUT SAID, SOMEBODY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY. I WANT TO HAVE A SURCHARGE ON INCOMES ABOVE $5 MILLION. WE HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO IN SPREES IN YOU. I WANT TO INVEST IN HARD WORKING FAMILIES.

SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT HIM OFF AND SHE SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, LAUGHING AT THE GIRL WHO WAS RAPED. KATHY SHELTON, THAT YOUNG WOMAN, IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT. SO, DON'T TELL ME ABOUT WORDS. I AM ABSOLUTELY, I APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAY. BUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID, HE WAS IMPEACHED, HE LOST HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. HE HAD TO PAY AN $850,000 FINE TO ONE OF THE WOMEN. PAULA JONES, WHO IS ALSO HERE TONIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN HILLARY BRINGS UP A POINT LIKE THAT SHE TALKS ABOUT WORDS THAT I SAID 11 YEARS AGO, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND I THINK SHE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. [ Applause ] >> CAN WE PLEASE HOLD THE APPLAUSE? SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. >> WELL, FIRST, LET ME START BY SAYING, SO MUCH OF WHAT HE'S JUST SAID IS NOT RIGHT BUT HE GETS TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN ANYWAY HE CHOOSES. GETS TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. INSTEAD OF ANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS, TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENDA, LAYING OUT THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE THINKING MAKE A BETTER LIFE AND A BETTER COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, MICHELLE OBAMA ADVISED US ALL. WHEN THEY GO LOW, YOU GO HIGH. [ Applause ] AND, LOOK, IF THIS WERE JUST ABOUT ONE VIDEO, MAYBE WHAT HE'S SAYING TONIGHT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT EVERYONE CAN DRAW THEIR OWN I'M GOING TO SAY IT. I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED. IN THE FIRST DEBATE -- >> THE AUDIENCE NEEDS TO CALL DOWN HERE. >> -- WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FACT CHECKING DONALD ALL THE TIME. I'D NEVER GET TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT TO DO, HOW WE'RE GOING TO REALLY MAKE LIVES BETTER FOR PEOPLE. SO, ONCE AGAIN, GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM WE HAVE LITERALLY, YOU CAN FACT CHECK HIM IN REALTIME. LAST TIME THE FIRST DEBATE WE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FACT CHECKING SO I EXPECTS WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP THAT GENERATED MILLIONS OF VOT VOTES. THIS QUESTION INVOLVES WIKILEAKSS RELEASED SUPPORT EXCERPTS OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S PAID SPEECHES WHICH SHE HAS REFUSED TO RELEASE. ONE LINE IN PARTICULAR IN WHICH YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON, REPORTEDLY SAID YOU NEED BOTH A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POSITION ON CERTAIN ISSUES. SO, TWO, FROM VIRGINIA, ASKEDS IT OKAY FOR POLITICIANS TO BE TWO-FACED? IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A PRIVATE STANCE ON ISSUES. SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, RIGHT, AS I RECALL THAT WAS SOMETHING I SAID ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN AFTER HAVING SEEN THE WONDERFUL STEVEN SPIELBERG MOVIE CALLED \"LINCOLN.\" IT WAS A MASTER CLASS WATCHING PRESIDENT LINCOLN GET THE CONGRESS TO APPROVE THE 13th AMENDMENT. IT WAS PRINCIPLED, IT WAS STRATEGIC. AND I WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT IT IS HARD SOMETIMES TO GET THE CONGRESS TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT AND, YES, PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE SOME PEOPLE HE USED SOME ARGUMENTS, CONVINCING OTHER PEOPLE, HE USED OTHER ARGUMENTS, THAT WAS A GREAT -- I THOUGHT A GREAT DISPLAY OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. BUT, YOU KNOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE, MARTHA, BECAUSE OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY JUST CAME OUT AND SAID IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, THAT THE KREMLIN, MEANING PUTIN AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, ARE DIRECTING THE ATTACKS, THE HACKING ON AMERICAN ACCOUNTS TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. AND WIKILEAKS IS PART OF THAT, AS ARE OTHER SITES WHERE THE RUSSIANS HACK INFORMATION, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S ACCURATE INFORMATION, THEN THEY PUT IT OUT. WE HAVE NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE AN ADVERSARY, A FOREIGN POWER, IS WORKING SO HARD TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. AND BELIEVE ME, THEY'RE NOT DOING IT TO GET ME ELECTED. THEY'RE DOING IT TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION FOR DONALD TRUMP. NOW, MAYBE BECAUSE HE HAS PRAISED PUTIN, MAYBE BECAUSE HE SAYS HE AGREES WITH A LOT OF WHAT PUTIN WANTS TO DO, MAYBE BECAUSE HE WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN MOSCOW, I DON'T KNOW THE REASONS. BUT WE DESERVE ANSWERS. AND WE SHOULD DEMAND THAT DONALD RELEASE ALL OF HIS TAX RETURNS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT ARE THE INTANGLEMENTS AND -- >> WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER. SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU'RE OUT OF TIME. >> I THINK SHY RESPOND BECAUSE -- SHY RESPOND SO RIDICULOUS. NOW SHE'S BLAMING -- SHE GOT CAUGHT IN A TOTAL LIE. HER PAPERS WENT OUT TO ALL HER FRIENDS AT THE BANK, GOLDMAN SACHS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. AND SHE SAID THINGS WIKILEAKS THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED. NOW SHE'S BLAMING THE LIE ON THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN TAKING PASSIONS. I WANT TO HAVE A TAX ON PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS, IT'S CALLED THE BUFFETT, HE'S GONE OUT SAID, SOMEBODY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY. I WANT TO HAVE A SURCHARGE ON INCOMES ABOVE $5 MILLION. WE HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO IN SPREES IN YOU. I WANT TO INVEST IN HARD WORKING FAMILIES. I THINK IT'S BEEN UNFORTUNATE BUT IT'S HAPPENED. THAT SINCE THE GREAT RESECTION THE GAINS HAVE ALL GONE TO THE TOP. AND WE NEED TO REVERSE. THAT PEOPLE LIKE DONALD WHO PAY ZERO IN TAXES, ZERO FOR OUR VETS, ZERO FOR OUR MILITARY, ZERO FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION, THAT IS WRONG. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY, NO CORPORATION, AND NO INDIVIDUAL CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT PAYING HIS FAIR SHARE. >> THANK YOU. MR. TRUMP GIVE CHANCE TO RESPOND JUST TELL OUR VIEWERS WHAT SHE'S REFERRING TO. LAST MONTH TAXES WERE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE ON FACEBOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE CAMPAIGN. \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PUBLISHED THREE PAGES OF YOUR 1995 TAX RETURN, SHOW YOU CLAIMED $960 MILLION LOSS. WHICH MEANS YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED PAYING PERSONAL FEDERAL INCOME TAXES FOR YEARS, WE'VE SAID YOU PAY STATE TAXES, REAL ESTATE TAXES, PROPERTY TAXES, YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED THOUGH SIMPLE QUESTION, DID YOU USE THAT $ED 60 MILLION LOSS TO AVOID PAYING PERSONAL FED RAM INCOME TAX. >> OF COURSE I DO. SO DO ALL OF HER DONORS OR MOST OF HER DONORS. I KNOW MANY OF HER DONORS. THEY TOOK MASSIVE TAX WRITE-OFFS. >> HAVE YOU -- LOT OF MY WRITE OFF WAS DEPRECIATION AND OTHER THINGS THAT HILLARY AS SENATOR ALLOWED. SHE'LL ALWAYS ALLOW PEOPLE THAT GIVE HER ALL THIS MONEY THEY WANT IT. THAT'S WHY. SEE I UNDERSTAND THE TAX CODE BETTER THAN ANYBODY THAT'S EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HILLARY CLINTON AND IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLEX, HILLARY CLINTON HAS FRIENDS THAT WANT ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDING THEY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO WALL STREET PEOPLE. BUT THEY REALLY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION. WHICH I BELIEVE HILLARY'S LEAVING, VERY INTERESTING WHY SHE'S LEAVING CARRIED INTEREST. I'LL TELL THAT YOU NUMBER ONE I PAY TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF TAXES. I ABSOLUTELY USED IT. SO DID WARREN BUFFETT AND GEORGE SOROS MANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HILLARY IS GETTING MONEY FROM. NOW, I WON'T MENTION THEIR NAMES BECAUSE THEY'RE RICH BUT NOT WHO ARE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS, IT'S CALLED THE BUFFETT, HE'S GONE OUT SAID, SOMEBODY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY.

IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, MUSLIM BAN IS SOMETHING THAT IN SOME FORM HAS MORPHED INTO A EXTREME VETTING FROM CERTAIN AREAS OF THE WORLD. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO ALLOW -- >> WHY DID IT MORPH INTO THAT -- NO, ANSWER THE QUESTION. >> WHY DIDN'T YOU INTERRUPTED YOU. SEEN THE WONDERFUL STEVEN SPIELBERG MOVIE CALLED \"LINCOLN.\" IT WAS A MASTER CLASS WATCHING THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED. YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED THOUGH SIMPLE QUESTION, DID YOU USE THAT $ED 60 MILLION LOSS TO WANT TO REMIND YOU WHAT YOUR RUNNING MATE SAID. PROVOCATIONS BY RUSSIA NEED TO BE MET WITH AMERICAN STRENGTH THAT IF RUSSIA CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN AIRSTRIKES ALONG WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES OF ASSAD, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE PREPARED TO USE MILITARY FORCE THINGS AND MUCH BIGGER THINGS. >> JUST FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO THAT DID YOU NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONCEMENT. >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN. NO ONE HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO. >> YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEVER DID THAT? >> FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS. THEY ARE SAID. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT.

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BORDERS, WHICH WE DON'T HAVE NOW. PEOPLE ARE POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY. AND THEY'RE COMING IN FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND OTHER PLACES. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA SAFER AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND WEALTHY AGAIN. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, IT JUST -- SOUNDS HARSH TO SAY, BUT WE HAVE TO BUILD UP THE WEALTH OF -- >> THANK YOU, MR.

I AM A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS NATION THAT HAS BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT HIM OFF AND SHE SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, LAUGHING AT THE GIRL WHO WAS RAPED. KATHY SHELTON, THAT YOUNG WOMAN, IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT. SO, DON'T TELL ME ABOUT WORDS. I AM ABSOLUTELY, I APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAY. BUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID, HE WAS IMPEACHED, HE LOST HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. HE HAD TO PAY AN $850,000 FINE TO ONE OF THE WOMEN. PAULA JONES, WHO IS ALSO HERE TONIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN HILLARY BRINGS UP A POINT LIKE THAT SHE TALKS ABOUT WORDS THAT I SAID 11 YEARS AGO, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND I THINK SHE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. [ Applause ] >> CAN WE PLEASE HOLD THE APPLAUSE? SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. >> WELL, FIRST, LET ME START BY SAYING, SO MUCH OF WHAT HE'S JUST SAID IS NOT RIGHT BUT HE GETS TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN ANYWAY HE CHOOSES. GETS TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. INSTEAD OF ANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS, TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENDA, LAYING OUT THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE THINKING MAKE A BETTER LIFE AND A BETTER COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, MICHELLE OBAMA ADVISED US ALL. WHEN THEY GO LOW, YOU GO HIGH. [ Applause ] AND, LOOK, IF THIS WERE JUST ABOUT ONE VIDEO, MAYBE WHAT HE'S SAYING TONIGHT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT EVERYONE CAN DRAW THEIR OWN I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS.

YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED. IN THE FIRST DEBATE -- >> THE AUDIENCE NEEDS TO CALL DOWN HERE. >> -- WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FACT CHECKING DONALD ALL THE TIME. I'D NEVER GET TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT TO DO, HOW WE'RE GOING TO REALLY MAKE LIVES BETTER FOR PEOPLE. SO, ONCE AGAIN, GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM WE HAVE LITERALLY, YOU CAN FACT CHECK HIM IN REALTIME. LAST TIME THE FIRST DEBATE WE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FACT CHECKING SO I EXPECTS WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP VOTES. THIS QUESTION INVOLVES WIKILEAKSS RELEASED SUPPORT EXCERPTS OF SECRETARY CLINTON'S PAID SPEECHES WHICH SHE HAS REFUSED TO RELEASE. ONE LINE IN PARTICULAR IN WHICH YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON, REPORTEDLY SAID YOU NEED BOTH A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POSITION ON CERTAIN ISSUES. SO, TWO, FROM VIRGINIA, ASKEDS IT OKAY FOR POLITICIANS TO BE TWO-FACED? IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A PRIVATE STANCE ON ISSUES. SECRETARY CLINTON. >> WELL, RIGHT, AS I RECALL THAT WAS SOMETHING I SAID ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN AFTER HAVING SEEN THE WONDERFUL STEVEN SPIELBERG MOVIE CALLED \"LINCOLN.\" IT WAS A MASTER CLASS WATCHING PRESIDENT LINCOLN GET THE CONGRESS TO APPROVE THE 13th AMENDMENT. IT WAS PRINCIPLED, IT WAS STRATEGIC. AND I WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT IT IS HARD SOMETIMES TO GET THE CONGRESS TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT AND, YES, PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE SOME PEOPLE HE USED SOME ARGUMENTS, CONVINCING OTHER PEOPLE, HE USED OTHER ARGUMENTS, THAT WAS A GREAT -- I THOUGHT A GREAT DISPLAY OF PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. BUT, YOU KNOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE, MARTHA, BECAUSE OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY JUST CAME OUT AND SAID IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, THAT THE KREMLIN, MEANING PUTIN AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, ARE DIRECTING THE ATTACKS, THE HACKING ON AMERICAN ACCOUNTS TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. AND WIKILEAKS IS PART OF THAT, AS ARE OTHER SITES WHERE THE RUSSIANS HACK INFORMATION, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S ACCURATE INFORMATION, THEN THEY PUT IT OUT. WE HAVE NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE AN ADVERSARY, A FOREIGN POWER, IS WORKING SO HARD TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. AND BELIEVE ME, THEY'RE NOT DOING IT TO GET ME ELECTED. THEY'RE DOING IT TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION FOR DONALD TRUMP. NOW, MAYBE BECAUSE HE HAS PRAISED PUTIN, MAYBE BECAUSE HE SAYS HE AGREES WITH A LOT OF WHAT PUTIN WANTS TO DO, MAYBE BECAUSE HE WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN MOSCOW, I DON'T KNOW THE REASONS. BUT WE DESERVE ANSWERS. AND WE SHOULD DEMAND THAT DONALD RELEASE ALL OF HIS TAX RETURNS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT ARE THE INTANGLEMENTS AND -- >> WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER. SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU'RE OUT OF TIME. >> I THINK SHY RESPOND BECAUSE -- SHY RESPOND SO RIDICULOUS. NOW SHE'S BLAMING -- SHE GOT CAUGHT IN A TOTAL LIE. HER PAPERS WENT OUT TO ALL HER FRIENDS AT THE BANK, GOLDMAN SACHS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. AND SHE SAID THINGS WIKILEAKS THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED. NOW SHE'S BLAMING THE LIE ON THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN TAKING PASSIONS. I WANT TO HAVE A TAX ON PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS, IT'S CALLED THE BUFFETT, HE'S GONE OUT SAID, SOMEBODY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY. I WANT TO HAVE A SURCHARGE ON INCOMES ABOVE $5 MILLION. WE HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO IN SPREES IN YOU. I WANT TO INVEST IN HARD WORKING FAMILIES. I THINK IT'S BEEN UNFORTUNATE BUT IT'S HAPPENED. THAT SINCE THE GREAT RESECTION THE GAINS HAVE ALL GONE TO THE TOP. AND WE NEED TO REVERSE. THAT PEOPLE LIKE DONALD WHO PAY ZERO IN TAXES, ZERO FOR OUR VETS, ZERO FOR OUR MILITARY, ZERO FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION, THAT IS WRONG. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY, NO CORPORATION, AND NO INDIVIDUAL CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT PAYING HIS FAIR SHARE. >> THANK YOU. WHO ARE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS, IT'S CALLED THE BUFFETT, HE'S GONE OUT SAID, SOMEBODY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY.

WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY, NO CORPORATION, AND NO INDIVIDUAL CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT PAYING HIS FAIR SHARE. >> THANK YOU. MR. TRUMP GIVE CHANCE TO RESPOND JUST TELL OUR VIEWERS WHAT SHE'S REFERRING TO. LAST MONTH TAXES WERE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE ON FACEBOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE CAMPAIGN. \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PUBLISHED THREE PAGES OF YOUR 1995 TAX RETURN, SHOW YOU CLAIMED $960 MILLION LOSS. WHICH MEANS YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED PAYING PERSONAL FEDERAL INCOME TAXES FOR YEARS, WE'VE SAID YOU PAY STATE TAXES, REAL ESTATE TAXES, PROPERTY TAXES, YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED THOUGH SIMPLE QUESTION, DID YOU USE THAT $ED 60 MILLION LOSS TO AVOID PAYING PERSONAL FED RAM INCOME TAX. >> OF COURSE I DO. SO DO ALL OF HER DONORS OR MOST OF HER DONORS. I KNOW MANY OF HER DONORS. THEY TOOK MASSIVE TAX WRITE-OFFS. >> HAVE YOU -- LOT OF MY WRITE OFF WAS DEPRECIATION AND OTHER THINGS THAT HILLARY AS SENATOR ALLOWED. SHE'LL ALWAYS ALLOW PEOPLE THAT GIVE HER ALL THIS MONEY THEY WANT IT. THAT'S WHY. SEE I UNDERSTAND THE TAX CODE BETTER THAN ANYBODY THAT'S EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HILLARY CLINTON AND IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLEX, HILLARY CLINTON HAS FRIENDS THAT WANT ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDING THEY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO WALL STREET PEOPLE. BUT THEY REALLY WANT CARRIED INTEREST PROVISION. WHICH I BELIEVE HILLARY'S LEAVING, VERY INTERESTING WHY SHE'S LEAVING CARRIED INTEREST. I'LL TELL THAT YOU NUMBER ONE I PAY TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF TAXES. I ABSOLUTELY USED IT. SO DID WARREN BUFFETT AND GEORGE SOROS MANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HILLARY IS GETTING MONEY FROM. NOW, I WON'T MENTION THEIR NAMES WHO ARE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS, IT'S CALLED THE BUFFETT, HE'S GONE OUT SAID, SOMEBODY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY.

GETS TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. INSTEAD OF ANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS, TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENDA, LAYING OUT THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE THINKING MAKE A BETTER LIFE AND A BETTER COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP ALTERNATIVE REALITY.

WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP ALTERNATIVE REALITY. AND IT IS SORT OF AMUSING TO IN THE TAX CODE. YES, WHEN I WAS A SENATOR I DID VOTE TO CLOSE CORPORATE LOOPHOLES. VOTED TO CLOSE ONE OF THE LOOPHOLES HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF WHEN HE CLAIMED BILLION DOLLAR LOSS THAT ENABLED HIM TO AVOID TAKING PASSIONS. I WANT TO HAVE A TAX ON PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS, IT'S CALLED THE BUFFETT, HE'S GONE OUT SAID, SOMEBODY LIKE HIM SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY. I WANT TO HAVE A SURCHARGE ON INCOMES ABOVE $5 MILLION. WE HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BECAUSE I WANT TO IN SPREES IN YOU. I WANT TO INVEST IN HARD WORKING FAMILIES. I THINK IT'S BEEN UNFORTUNATE BUT IT'S HAPPENED. THAT SINCE THE GREAT RESECTION THE GAINS HAVE ALL GONE TO THE TOP. AND WE NEED TO REVERSE. THAT PEOPLE LIKE DONALD WHO PAY ZERO IN TAXES, ZERO FOR OUR VETS, ZERO FOR OUR MILITARY, ZERO FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION, THAT IS WRONG. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY, NO CORPORATION, AND NO INDIVIDUAL CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT PAYING HIS FAIR SHARE. >> THANK YOU. MR.

LAST MONTH TAXES WERE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE ON FACEBOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE CAMPAIGN. \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PUBLISHED THREE PAGES OF YOUR 1995 TAX RETURN, SHOW YOU CLAIMED $960 MILLION LOSS. WHICH MEANS YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED PAYING PERSONAL FEDERAL INCOME TAXES FOR YEARS, WE'VE SAID YOU PAY STATE TAXES, REAL ESTATE TAXES, PROPERTY TAXES, YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED THOUGH SIMPLE QUESTION, DID YOU USE THAT $ED 60 MILLION LOSS TO WHICH I BELIEVE HILLARY'S LEAVING, VERY INTERESTING WHY SHE'S LEAVING CARRIED INTEREST.

ANDERSON COOPER. >> GOOD EVENING. I'M MARTHA RADDATZ FROM ABC NEWS. >> WELCOME YOU TO ST. LOUIS TO THE SEC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP. SPONSORED BY THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES. TONIGHT'S DEBATE IS A TOWN HALL FORMAT WHICH GIVES VOTERS A CHANCE TO DIRECTLY ASK THE CANDIDATES QUESTIONS. MARTHA AND I WILL ASK FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS BUT THE NIGHT BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE SUBMITTED QUESTIONS ONLINE. >> THE PEOPLE YOU SEE ON THIS STAGE WERE CHOSEN BY THE GALLUP ORGANIZATION, THEY ARE ALL FROM THE ST. LOUIS AREA, TOLD GALLUP THEY HAVEN'T COMMITTED TO A CANDIDATE. EACH OF THEM CAME HERE WITH QUESTIONS THEY WANT TO ASK AND WE SAW THOSE QUESTIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS MORNING. ANDERSON AND I AND OUR TEAM FROM ABC AND CNN ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE SEEN THEM. BOTH CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES TO ANSWER EACH AUDIENCE AND ONLINE QUESTION, WE HOPE THE GET TO AS MANY QUESTIONS AS WE CAN SO WE'VE ASKED THE AUDIENCE HERE NOT TO HAVE ANY APPLAUSE EXCEPT FOR NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT, JOHN CALLED J. TRUMP AND THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON. [ Applause ] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE'LL BEGIN WITH A QUESTIROM ONE OF THE MEMBERS IN OUR TOWN HALL, EACH OF YOU WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES TO RESPOND. SECRETARY CLINTON YOU WON THE COIN TOSS YOU'LL GO FIRST OUR FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM PATRICE BROCK. >> I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. BECAUSE I'VE HEARD FROM LOTS OF TEACHERS AND PARENTS ABOUT SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING SAID AND DONE IN THIS CAMPAIGN. AND I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE CLEAR TO OUR CHILDREN THAT OUR COUNTRY REALLY IS GREAT BECAUSE WE'RE GOOD. AND WE ARE GOING TO RESPECT ONE ANOTHER, LIFT EACH OTHER UP. WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO CELEBRATE OUR DIVERSITY. AND WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO REACH OUT TO EVERY BOY AND GIRL AS WELL AS EVERY ADULT TO BRING THEM IN TO WORKING ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE A VERY POSITIVE AND OPTIMISTIC VIEW ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY THE SLOGAN OF MY CAMPAIGN IS STRONGER TOGETHER. BECAUSE I THINK IF WE WORK TOGETHER, IF WE OVERCOME THE DIVISIVENESS THAT SOMETIMES SETS AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND INSTEAD WE MAKE SOME BIG GOALS AND I'VE SET FORTH SOME BIG GOALS GETTING THE ECONOMY TO WORK FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST EDUCATION SYSTEM FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH COLLEGE AND MAKING IT AFFORDABLE, AND SO MUCH ELSE. IF WE SET THOSE GOALS AND WE GO TOGETHER TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THEM, THERE'S NOTHING IN MY OPINION THAT AMERICA CAN'T DO. SO THAT'S WHY I HOPE THAT WE WILL COME TOGETHER IN THIS CAMPAIGN, OBVIOUSLY I'M HOPING TO EARN YOUR VOTE. I'M HOPING TO BE ELECTED IN NOVEMBER AND I CAN PROMISE YOU, I WILL WORK WITH EVERY AMERICAN, I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT FOR THAT. I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING SHE SAID. I BEGAN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I WAS SO TIRED OF SEEING SUCH FOOLISH THINGS HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY. THIS IS A GREAT LAND. I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF THAT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS AS A POLITICIAN. I CANNOT BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT ABOUT MYSELF BUT I GUESS I HAVE BEEN A POLITICIAN. AND MY WHOLE CONCEPT WAS TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHEN I WATCH THE DEALS BEING MADE, WHEN I WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH SOME HORRIBLE THINGS LIKE OBAMACARE WHERE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE AND HEALTHCARE IS GOING UP BY NUMBERS THAT ARE ASTRONOMICAL, 68%, 59%, 71% WHEN I LOOK AT THE IRAN DEAL HOW BAD A DEAL IT IS FOR US, IT'S A ONE-SIDED TRANSACTION WHERE WE'RE GIVING BACK $150 BILLION TO A TERRORIST STATE, REALLY THE NUMBER ONE TERRORIST STATE. WE'VE MADE THEM AING TO COUNTRY FROM A WEAK COUNTRY JUST THREE YEARS AGO. WHEN I LOOK AT ALL OF THE THINGE POTENTIAL THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS, WE HAVE SUCH TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL, WHETHER IT'S IN BUSINESS AND TRADE WHERE WE'RE DOING SO BADLY. LAST YEAR WE HAD AN ALMOST $800 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT. IN OTHER WORDS, TRADING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. WE HAD $800 BILLION DEFICIT. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. INCONCEIVABLE. YOU SAY WHO IS MAKING THESE DEALS? WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GRADE DEALS. HAVE A STRONG BORDER. BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER. JUST TODAY A POLICEMEN WERE SHOT, TWO KILLED, THIS IS HAPPENING ON A WEEKLY BASIS. CITIES BETTER FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN CITIZENS THAT ARE SO GREAT AND FOR LATINOS, HISPANICS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO DOING TH THIS. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. >> THANK YOU, MR. TRUMP. THE QUESTION FROM PATRICE WAS ABOUT ARE YOU BOTH MODELING POSITIVE AND APPROPRIATE BEHAVIORS FOR TODAY'S YOUTH. WE RECEIVED LOT OF QUESTIONS ONLINE, MR. TRUMP, ABOUT THE TAPE THAT WAS RELEASED FRIDAY YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU CALLED WHAT YOU SAID LOCKER ROOM BANTER, KISSING WOMEN WITHOUT CONSTENT, GRABBING THEIR GENITALS THAT IS SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU DRAGGED THAT YOU HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK. WHEN WE HAVE A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE ISIS CHOPPING OFF HEADS, WHERE YOU HAVE -- FRANKLY DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES WHERE YOU HAVE WARS AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SITES ALL OVER, WHERE YOU HAVE SO MANY BAD THINGS HAPPENING, THIS IS LIKE MEDIEVAL TIMES, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THE CARNAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND THEY LOOK AND THEY SEE, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRANKLY DOING SO WELL AGAINST US WE SAW HIM AFTER THE FIRST DEBATE DEPEND NEARLY A WEEK DENIGRATING A FORMER MISS UNIVERSE IN THE HARSHEST, POST PERSONAL TERM. SO, YES, THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP S. BUT IT'S NOT ONLY WOMEN AND IT'S NOT ONLY THIS VIDEO THAT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FITNESS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE HE HAS ALSO TARGETED IMMIGRANTS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, LATINOS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, P.O.W.s, MUSLIMS, SO MANY OTHERS. SO THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. THE QUESTION FOR US, THE QUESTION OUR COUNTRY MUST ANSWER IS, THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT'S WHY TO GO BACK TO YOUR QUESTION, I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE, WE ALL SHOULD, TO EVERY BOY AND GIRL AND DEED TO THE ENTIRE WORLD, THAT AMERICA ALREADY IS GREAT BUT WE ARE GREAT BECAUSE WE ARE GOOD. AND WE WILL RESPECT ONE ANOTHER AND WE WILL WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND WE WILL CELEBRATE OUR DIVERSITY. THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT VALUES TO ME. BECAUSE THIS IS THE AMERICA THAT I KNOW AND LOVE. I AM A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS NATION THAT HAS BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT HIM OFF AND SHE SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, LAUGHING AT THE GIRL WHO WAS RAPED. KATHY SHELTON, THAT YOUNG WOMAN, IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT. SO, DON'T TELL ME ABOUT WORDS. I AM ABSOLUTELY, I APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAY. BUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID, HE WAS IMPEACHED, HE LOST HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. HE HAD TO PAY AN $850,000 FINE TO ONE OF THE WOMEN. PAULA JONES, WHO IS ALSO HERE TONIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN HILLARY BRINGS UP A POINT LIKE THAT SHE TALKS ABOUT WORDS THAT HILLARYCLINTON.COM WE HAVE LITERALLY, YOU CAN FACT CHECK HIM IN REALTIME. LAST TIME THE FIRST DEBATE WE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FACT CHECKING SO I EXPECTS WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP IS NOT IN CHARGE OF THE LAW IN OUR COUNTRY. >> BECAUSE YOU'D BE IN JAIL. >> SECRETARY CLINTON -- [  AUDIENCE REACTS ] >> REMIND THE AUDIENCE TO PLEASE NOT TALK OUT LOUD, PLEASE DO NOT APPLAUD, YOU'RE JUST WASTING TIME. >> SECRETARY CLINTON I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON E-MAILS. YOU SAID YOU'RE HANDLING YOUR E-MAILS WAS A MISTAKE, YOU DISAGREED WITH DIRECTOR -- FBI DIRECTOR CALL YOUR HAMMING OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, QUOTE, EXTREMELY CARELESS. THE FBI SAID THAT THERE WERE 110 CLASSIFIED E-MAILS THAT WERE EXCHANGED. EIGHT OF WHICH WERE TOP SECRET. THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE DID GAIN ACCESS TO THOSE E-MAILS. SAW DON'T CALL THAT EXTREMELY CARELESS? >> WELL, MARTHA, FIRST LET ME SAY, I'VE SAID IT BEFORE OUT I'LL REPEAT BECAUSE I WANT EVERYONE TO HEAR IT. THAT WAS A MISTAKE. AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR USING A PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT. OBVIOUSLY IF I WERE TO DO IT OVER AGAIN I WOULD NOT. I'M NOT MAKING ANY EXCUSES. IT WAS A MISTAKE. I AM VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT WHERE THERE ARE SOME MISLEADING ACCUSATIONS FROM CRITICS AND OTHERS. AFTER A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANYONE HACKED THE SERVER I WAS USING. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY ONE CAN POINTED TO, AT ALL, ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE HAS NO BASIS, THAT ANY CLASSIFIED MATERIAL ENDED UP IN THE WRONG HANDS. I TAKE CLASSIFIED MATERIAL VERY SERIOUSLY. AND ALWAYS HAVE WHEN I WAS ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, I WAS PRIVY TO A LOT OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL. OBVIOUSLY AS SECRETARY OF STATE, I HAD SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SECRETS THAT WE POSSESS, SUCH AS GOING AFTER BIN LADEN. SO, I AM VERY COMMITTED TO TAKING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION SERIOUSLY AND AS I SAID THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ENDED UP IN THE WRONG HANDS. >> WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON. >> AND YET SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE WORD -- LET SNEER C\" ON DOCUME DOCUMENT, RIGHT, SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT WORD -- WHAT THAT LETTER MEANT. IT'S AMAZING I'M WATCHING MIL REGO OVER FACTS. SHE'S GOING AFTER FACT AFTER FACT. SHE'S LYING AGAIN. BECAUSE SHE'S SAID SHE -- WHAT SHE DID WITH E-MAILS WAS FINE. YOU THINK IT WAS FINE TO DELETE SO. SHE SAID THAT 33,000 E-MAILS HAD TO DO WITH HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING, NUMBER ONE. AND A YOGA CLASS. WELL MAYBE WE'LL GIVE THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE -- 33,000 E-MAILS DELETED. NOW SHE'S SAYING THERE WASN'T ANYTHING WRONG. MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WAS AFTER GETTING A SUBPOENA. THAT WASN'T BEFORE. THAT WAS AFTER SHE -- SHE GOT IT FROM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS I'LL BE HONEST I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN CONGRESSMAN, INCLUDING REPUBLICANS FOR ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN. OUR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHERE HER HUSBAND GOES ON TO THE BACK OF AIRPLANE FOR 39 MINUTES, TALKS TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, DAYS BEFORE RULING IS GOING TO BE MADE ON HER CASE. BUT FOR YOU TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU DELETING 39,000 E-MAILS, AGAIN, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. WHAT YOU DID. THIS IS AFTER GETTING A SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. >> WE THAT HAVE TOO MOVE ON SECRETARY CLIP TON WE CAN RESPOND -- >> WE WANT TO GIVE THE AUDIENCE A CHANCE HERE. >> LET ALONE AFTER GETTING A SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED STATES -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON YOU YOU CAN SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS. NUMBER THREE, WOMEN CAN'T BE CHARGED MORE THAN MEN FOR OUR HEALTH INSURANCE, WHICH IS THE WAY IT USED TO BE. BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. NUMBER FOUR, IF YOU'RE UNDER 26 AND YOUR PARENTS HAVE A POLICY YOU CAN BE ON THAT POLICY UNTIL THE AGE OF 26. SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BEFORE. SO, I WANT VERY MUCH TO SAVE WHAT WORKS AND IS GOOD ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET COSTS DOWN. WE'VE GOT TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL HELP TO SMALL BUSINESSES SO THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE. BUT IF WE REPEAL IT AS DONALD HAS PROPOSED, AND START OVER AGAIN, ALL OF THOSE BENEFITS I JUST MENTIONED ARE LOST TO EVERYBODY. NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO GET THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE ON THE EXCHANGE. AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN. RIGHT NOW WE ARE AT 90% HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. THAT'S HIGHEST WE'VE EVER BEEN IN OUR COUNTRY. >> YOUR TIME IS UP. I WANT TO GET 100% BUT GET COSTS DOWN KEEP QUALITY UP. >> MR. TRUMP YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. >> IT IS SUCH A GREAT QUESTION. AND IT'S MAYBEMENT QUESTION I GET ALMOST MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. OUTSIDE OF DEFENSE. OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER. YOU KNOW IT, WE ALL KNOW IT. IT'S GOING UP AT NUMBERS THAT NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN WORLDWIDE. NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN NUMBERS LIKE THIS FOR HEALTH CARE. IT'S ONLY GETTING WORSE. IN '17 IT IMPLODES BY ITSELF. THEIR METHOD OF FIXING IT TO GO BACK ASK CONGRESS FOR MORE AND MORE MONEY, WE HAVE RIGHT NOW ALMOST $20 TRILLION IN DEBT. OBAMACARE WILL NEVER WORK. IT'S VERY BAD, VERY BAD HEALTH INSURANCE. WORKS, WHERE YOUR PLAN CAN ACTUALLY BE TAILORED WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE LINES AROUND THE STATE. ARTIFICIAL LINES, WHERE WE STOP INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM COMING IN AND COMPETING, BECAUSE THEY WANT, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND WHOEVER WAS WORKING ON IT, THEY WANT TO LEAVE THOSE LINES BECAUSE THAT GIVES THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ESSENTIALLY MONOPOLIES. WE WANT COMPETITION. YOU WILL HAVE FINEST HEALTH CARE PLAN. SHE WANTS TO GO TO SINGLE PAYER PLAN WHICH WOULD BE DISASTER. SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO CANADA. IF YOU EVER NOTICED THAT CANADIANS WHEN THEY NEED A BIG OPERATION WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS THEY COME INTO THE UNITED STATES IN MANY CASES. BECAUSE THEIR SYSTEM IS SO SLOW, IT'S CATASTROPHIC IN CERTAIN WAYS. BUT SHE WANTS TO GO TO SINGLE PAYER. WHICH MEANS THE GOVERNMENT BASICALLY RULES EVERYTHING. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN AFTER THIS FOR YEARS. OBAMACARE WAS THE FIRST STEP, OBAMACARE IS A TOTAL DISASTER. NOT ONLY ARE YOUR RATES GOING UP BY NUMBERS THAT NOBODY HAS EVER BELIEVED, BUT YOU DEDUCTIBLES ARE GOING UP. SO THAT UNLESS YOU GET HIT BY A TRUCK YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT. >>  MR. TRUMP YOUR TIME -- DISASTROUS PLAN IT HAS TO BE REPEALED AND REPLACED. >> SECRETARY CLINTON LET ME FOLLOW UP YOUR HUSBAND CALLED OBAMACARE, QUOTE, CRAZIEST THINGS IN THE WORLD SAYING THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE GETTING KILLED AS PREMIUMS DOUBLE, COVERAGE CUT IN HALF, WAS HE MISTAKEN OR WAS HIS MISTAKE SAYING THE TRUTH? >> HE CLARIFIED WHAT HE MEANT. IT'S VERY CLEAR, WE ARE IN A SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY WHERE IF WE WERE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN, WE MIGHT COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT SYSTEM. BUT WE HAVE AN EMPLOYER-BASED SYSTEM, THAT'S WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE GET THEIR HEALTH CARE. AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS MEANT TO TRY TO FILL THE GAP JOB DOING IT, BY THE WAY. THEN ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE EMPLOYED BUT PEOPLE WHO WERE WORKING BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO AFFORD INSURANCE AND DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY, AN EMPLOYER OR ANYBODY ELSE TO HELP THEM. THAT WAS THE SLOT THAT THE OBAMACARE APPROACH WAS TO TAKE. LIKE I SAY, 20 MILLION PEOPLE NOW HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. SO, IF WE JUST RIP IT UP AND THROW IT AWAY, WHAT DONALD NOT TELLING YOU, WE JUST TURN IT BACK TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THE WAY IT USED TO BE. AND THAT MEANS INSURANCE COMPANIES GET TO DO PRETTY MUCH WHATEVER THEY WANT INCLUDING SAYING, LOOK, I'M SORRY, YOU GOT DIABETES, YOU HAD CANCER, YOUR CHILD HAS ASTHMA -- >> YOUR TIME IS SUBPOENA. >> YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE INSURANCE. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT. LET'S FIX WHAT'S BROKEN, BUT LET'S NOT THROW IT AWAY AND GIVE IT ALL BACK TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES -- >> LET ME FOLLOW U7, MR. TRUMP, ON THIS -- >> JUST ONE THING. EVERYTHING IS BROKEN ABOUT IT, EVERYTHING. NUMBER TWO, BERNIE SANDERS SAID THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS VERY BAD JUDGMENT. THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF IT. >> MR. TRUMP -- TRYING TO SAVE OBAMACARE -- YOU SAID YOU WANT TO OBAMACARE AND WANT TO MAKE COVERAGE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, HOW DO YOU FORCE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO DO THAT IF YOU ARE NO LONGER MANDATING -- >> YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE PLANS -- >> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PLANS THAT ARE SO GOOD BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SO MUCH COMPETITION IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, ONCE WE BREAK OUT -- ONCE WE BREAK OUT THE LINES ALLOW THE COMPETITION TO COME. >> ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A MANDATE THAT -- >> EXCUSE ME. PRESIDENT OBAMA BY KEEPING THOSE LINES, BOUNDARY LINES AROUND EACH, WAS ALMOST GONE UNTIL JUST VERY TOWARD THE END OF THE MESSAGE OF OBAMACARE. >> GOOD EVENING. I'M MARTHA RADDATZ FROM ABC NEWS. >> WELCOME YOU TO ST. LOUIS TO THE SEC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP. SPONSORED BY THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES. TONIGHT'S DEBATE IS A TOWN HALL FORMAT WHICH GIVES VOTERS A CHANCE TO DIRECTLY ASK THE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHEN I WATCH THE DEALS BEING MADE, WHEN I WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH SOME HORRIBLE THINGS LIKE OBAMACARE WHERE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE AND HEALTHCARE GRABBING THEIR GENITALS THAT IS SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU DRAGGED THAT YOU HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK. WHEN WE HAVE A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE ISIS CHOPPING OFF HEADS, WHERE YOU HAVE -- FRANKLY DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES WHERE YOU HAVE WARS AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SITES ALL OVER, WHERE YOU HAVE SO MANY BAD THINGS HAPPENING, THIS IS LIKE MEDIEVAL TIMES, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THE CARNAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND THEY LOOK AND THEY SEE, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRANKLY DOING SO WELL AGAINST US WITH ISIS. AND THEY LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY THEY SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. YES, I'M VERY EMBARRASSED BY IT. I HATE IT. SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK. WHEN WE HAVE A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE ISIS CHOPPING OFF HEADS, WHERE YOU HAVE -- FRANKLY DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES WHERE YOU HAVE WARS AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SITES ALL OVER, WHERE YOU HAVE SO MANY BAD THINGS HAPPENING, THIS IS LIKE MEDIEVAL TIMES, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THE CARNAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND THEY LOOK AND THEY SEE, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRANKLY DOING SO WELL AGAINST US WITH ISIS. AND THEY LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY THEY SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. YES, I'M VERY EMBARRASSED BY IT. I HATE IT. BUT IT'S LOCKER ROOM TALK. AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS, I WILL KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS. WE'RE GOING TO DEFEAT ISIS. ISIS HAPPENED NUMBER OF YEARS AGO IN A VACUUM THAT WAS LEFT BECAUSE OF BAD JUDGMENT I WELL TELL YOU, I WILL TAKE CARE OF ISIS. >> MR. TRUMP -- GET ON TO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THINGS AND MUCH BIGGER THINGS. >> JUST FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO THAT DID YOU NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONCEMENT. >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN. NO ONE HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO. >> YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEVER DID THAT? >> FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS. THEY ARE SAID. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT. BUT I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR WOMEN. >> HAVE YOU EVER DONE -- I HAVE RESPECT FOR ME. >> WELL, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING OVER THE LAST 48 HOURS ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD AND SAW. YOU KNOW, WITH PRIOR REPUBLICAN NOMINEES FOR PRESIDENT, I DISAGREED WITH THEM. ON POLITICS, POLICIES, PRINCIPLE, BUT I NEVER QUESTIONED THEIR FITNESS TO SERVE. DONALD TRUMP IS DIFFERENT. I SAID STARTING BACK IN JUNE THAT HE WAS NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF. AND MANY REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS HAVE SAID THE SAME THING. WHAT WE ALL SAW AND HEARD ON FRIDAY WAS DONALD TALKING ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE DOES TO WOMEN. AND HE HAS SAID THAT THE VIDEO DOESN'T REPRESENT WHO HE IS. BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR TO ANYONE WHO HEARD IT THAT IT REPRESENTS EXACTLY WHO HE IS. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE SEEN HIM INSULT WOMEN. WE HAVE SEEN HIM RATE WOMEN ON THEIR APPEARANCE, RANKING THEM FROM ONE TO TEN. WE'VE SEEN HIM EMBARRASS WOMEN ON TV AND ON TWITTER. WE SAW HIM AFTER THE FIRST DEBATE DEPEND NEARLY A WEEK DENIGRATING A FORMER MISS UNIVERSE IN THE HARSHEST, POST PERSONAL TERM. SO, YES, THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP S. BUT IT'S NOT ONLY WOMEN AND IT'S NOT ONLY THIS VIDEO THAT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FITNESS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE HE HAS ALSO TARGETED IMMIGRANTS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, LATINOS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, P.O.W.s, MUSLIMS, SO MANY OTHERS. SO THIS IS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. THE QUESTION FOR US, THE QUESTION OUR COUNTRY MUST ANSWER IS, THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT'S WHY TO GO BACK TO YOUR QUESTION, I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE, WE ALL SHOULD, TO EVERY I AM NOT PROUD OF IT. I AM A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS NATION THAT HAS BEEN SO ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. SO, YOU CAN SAY, ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT BUT BILL CLINTON WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT HIM OFF AND SHE SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, LAUGHING AT THE GIRL WHO WAS RAPED. KATHY SHELTON, THAT YOUNG WOMAN, IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT. SO, DON'T TELL ME ABOUT WORDS. I AM ABSOLUTELY, I APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAY. BUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID, HE WAS IMPEACHED, HE LOST HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. HE HAD TO PAY AN $850,000 FINE TO ONE OF THE WOMEN. PAULA JONES, WHO IS ALSO HERE TONIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAYING, SO MUCH OF WHAT HE'S JUST SAID IS NOT RIGHT BUT HE GETS TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN ANYWAY HE CHOOSES. GETS TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. INSTEAD OF ANSWERING PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS, TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENDA, LAYING OUT THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE THINKING MAKE A BETTER LIFE AND A BETTER COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, OFFICE AND ARE NOW MISSING. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I DIDN'T THINK I'D SAY THIS BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT. I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU GET A SUBPOENA, AND AFTER YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED. IN THE FIRST DEBATE -- >> THE AUDIENCE NEEDS TO CALL DOWN HERE. >> -- WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FACT CHECKING DONALD ALL THE TIME. I'D NEVER GET TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT TO DO, HOW WE'RE GOING TO REALLY MAKE LIVES MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP CRITICS AND OTHERS. AFTER A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANYONE HACKED THE SERVER I WAS USING. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY ONE CAN POINTED TO, AT ALL, THIS IS NOT AN ORDINARY TIME AND THIS IS NOT AN ORDINARY ELECTION. WE ARE GOING TO BE CHOOSING A PRESIDENT WHO WILL SET POLICY FOR NOT JUST FOUR OR EIGHT YEARS BUT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE HERE AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD, FROM THE SUPREME COURT, TO ENERGY AND SO MUCH ELSE. I SAID 11 YEARS AGO, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND I THINK SHE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF, IF COUNTRY. THAT'S HIS CHOICE. WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU DRAGGED THAT YOU HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. THE CARNAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND THEY LOOK AND THEY SEE, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRANKLY DOING SO WELL AGAINST US WITH ISIS. AND THEY LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY THEY SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. I KNOW YOU'RE IN TO BIG DIVERSION TONIGHT, ANYTHING TO AVOID TALKING ABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN THE WAY IT'S EXPLODING THE WAY REPUBLICANS ARE LEAVING YOU. >> LET'S SHE WHAT HAPPENS -- ALLOW HER TO RESPOND. >> LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. >>  THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT TONIGHT. LET'S GET TO THEIR QUESTION. >> THE QUESTION HERE FROM KEN KARPOWICZ, A QUESTION ABOUT HEALTH CARE. >> ANDERSON WHY AREN'T YOU BRINGING UP THE E-MAILS? >> YOU BROUGHT UP THE E-MAILS. >> IT HASN'T. THAT? >> FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS. WE RECEIVED LOT OF QUESTIONS ONLINE, MR. TRUMP, ABOUT THE TAPE THAT WAS RELEASED FRIDAY YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU CALLED WHAT YOU SAID LOCKER ROOM BANTER, KISSING WOMEN WITHOUT CONSTENT, GRABBING THEIR GENITALS THAT IS SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU DRAGGED THAT YOU HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK. WHEN WE HAVE A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE ISIS CHOPPING OFF HEADS, WHERE YOU HAVE -- FRANKLY DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES WHERE YOU HAVE WARS AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU DRAGGED THAT YOU HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK. WHEN WE HAVE A WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE ISIS CHOPPING OFF HEADS, WHERE YOU HAVE -- FRANKLY THINGS AND MUCH BIGGER THINGS. >> JUST FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO THAT DID YOU NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONCEMENT. >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN. NO ONE HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO. >> YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEVER DID THAT? >> FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS. THEY ARE SAID. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT. ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD AND SAW. YOU KNOW, WITH PRIOR REPUBLICAN NOMINEES FOR PRESIDENT, I DISAGREED WITH THEM. ON POLITICS, POLICIES, PRINCIPLE, BUT I NEVER QUESTIONED THEIR FITNESS TO SERVE. DONALD TRUMP IS DIFFERENT. I SAID STARTING BACK IN JUNE THAT HE WAS NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF. AND MANY REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS HAVE SAID THE SAME THING. WHAT WE ALL SAW AND HEARD ON FRIDAY WAS DONALD TALKING ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE DOES TO WOMEN. AND HE HAS SAID THAT THE VIDEO THAT. I ASSUME I AM. >> YOU CAN RESPOND TO THAT. >> IT'S JUST WORDS, FOLKS. IT'S JUST WORDS. THOSE WORDS HAVE BEEN HEARING FOR MANY YEARS. I HEARD THEM WHEN THEY WERE FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN, HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE SHAME WOMEN. ATTACKED THEM VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12. HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED GOT HIM OFF AND SHE SEEN LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, LAUGHING THOSE WORDS. BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE S SAY. BUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID, HE WAS IMPEACHED, HE LOST HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW. HE HAD TO PAY AN $850,000 FINE TO ONE OF THE WOMEN. PAULA JONES, WHO IS ALSO HERE TONIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN HILLARY BRINGS UP A POINT LIKE THAT SHE TALKS ABOUT WORDS THAT I SAID 11 YEARS AGO, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND I THINK SHE LIVES HAVE BEEN DETRIED FOR DOING ONE FIFTH OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. IT'S A DISGRACE. YOU OUGHT TO BE -- >> SECRETARY CLINTON I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I'LL LET YOU TALK -- >> EVERYTHING GIST SAID IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED. IN THE FIRST DEBATE -- >> THE AUDIENCE NEEDS TO CALL DOWN HERE. >> -- WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BE FACT CHECKING DONALD ALL THE TIME. I'D NEVER GET TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING I WANT TO DO, HOW WE'RE GOING TO REALLY MAKE LIVES BETTER FOR PEOPLE. SO, ONCE AGAIN, GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM WE HAVE LITERALLY, YOU CAN FACT CHECK HIM IN REALTIME. LAST TIME THE FIRST DEBATE WE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FACT CHECKING SO I EXPECTS WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST >> LOOK, IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. PLEASE, GO TO -- >> ALLOW HER TO RESPOND. >> PERSONAL E-MAILS, NOT A -- >> WELL, WE TURNED OVER 35,000. >> OH, YEAH, WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER -- >> PLEASE ALLOW HER TO RESPOND. >> POCK, DONALD. I KNOW YOU'RE IN TO BIG DIVERSION TONIGHT, ANYTHING TO AVOID TALKING ABOUT YOUR KARPOWICZ, A QUESTION ABOUT HEALTH CARE. >> ANDERSON WHY AREN'T YOU BRINGING UP THE E-MAILS? PAID SPEECHES WHICH SHE HAS REFUSED TO RELEASE. ONE LINE IN PARTICULAR IN WHICH YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON, REPORTEDLY SAID YOU NEED BOTH A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POSITION ON CERTAIN ISSUES. SO, TWO, FROM VIRGINIA, ASKEDS IT OKAY FOR POLITICIANS TO BE DO AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT AND, YES, PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE SOME PEOPLE HE USED SOME ARGUMENTS, CONVINCING OTHER PEOPLE, HE USED OTHER ARGUMENTS, THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED. NOW SHE'S BLAMING THE LIE ON THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN THAT'S ONE THAT I HAVEN'T -- OKAY, HONEST ABE. FAIR AND IMPORTANT QUESTION. I RESPECT HIS CHILDREN. HIS CHILDREN ARE INCREDIBLY ABLE AND DEVOTED AND I THINK THAT HE SAYS A LOT ABOUT DONALD. I DON'T AGREE WITH NEARLY ANYTHING ELSE HE SAYS OR DOES. BUT I DO RESPECT THAT. DAY. >> MR. TRUMP? >> WELL, I CONSIDER HER STATEMENT ABOUT MY CHILDREN TO BE A VERY NICE COMPLIMENT. I DON'T KNOW FIT WAS MEANT TO BE COMPLIMENT BUT IT IS -- I'M VERY PROUD OF MY CHILDREN. THEY HAVE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB AND THEY HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL KIDS. I CONSIDER THAT A COMPLIMENT. COULD FIGHT ISIS TOGETHER AS AN EXAMPLE. BUT I DON'T KNOW PUTIN, BUT I NOTICE ANY TIME ANYTHING WRONG HAPPENS THEY LIKE TO SAY, THE RUSSIANS -- HERE IS THE RUSSIANS DOING THE HACKING, MAYBE THERE BUT ASSAD IS KILLING ISIS. RUSSIA IS KILLING ISIS. IRAN IS KILLING ISIS. IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT SYRIA AND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN ALEPPO I WANT TO REMIND YOU WHAT YOUR RUNNING MATE SAID. PROVOCATIONS BY RUSSIA NEED TO BE MET WITH AMERICAN STRENGTH THAT IF RUSSIA CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN AIRSTRIKES ALONG WITH THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES OF ASSAD, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE PREPARED TO USE MILITARY FORCE >> MR. TRUMP WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST? >> I CERTAINLY WILL. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A VERY FAIR AND IMPORTANT QUESTION. I RESPECT HIS CHILDREN. HIS CHILDREN ARE INCREDIBLY ABLE AND DEVOTED AND I THINK THAT HE I DISAGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT SHE'S FIGHTING FOR. I DID DISAGREE WITH HER JUDGMENT AND MANY CASES. GRABBING THEIR GENITALS THAT IS SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU DRAGGED THAT YOU HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED WOMEN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? >> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS SAID. THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. I APOLOGIZED TO MY FAMILY, I APOLOGIZED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. AND THEY LOOK AND THEY SEE, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRANKLY DOING SO WELL AGAINST US WITH ISIS. AND THEY LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY THEY SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. YES, I'M VERY EMBARRASSED BY IT. ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO THAT DID YOU NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONCEMENT. >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN. NO ONE HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO. >> YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEVER DID THAT? >> FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS. THEY ARE SAID. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT. SQUARE, IN MY OPINION. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TAKE A LOOK AT WIKILEAKS SEE WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS AND DEBRA WASSERMAN SCHULZ HAD IN MIND LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU GET A SUBPOENA, AND AFTER GETTING THE SUBPOENA, YOU DELETE THEN YOU AS IT WASH THEM OR BLEACH THEM AS YOU WOULD SAY, VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS. SO, WE'RE GOING TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN -- THEIR BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST RIDICULOUS. NOW SHE'S BLAMING -- SHE GOT CAUGHT IN A TOTAL LIE. HER PAPERS WENT OUT TO ALL HER FRIENDS AT THE BANK, GOLDMAN SACHS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. AND SHE SAID THINGS WIKILEAKS THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED. NOW SHE'S BLAMING THE LIE ON THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN THAT'S ONE THAT I HAVEN'T -- OKAY, HONEST ABE. >> JUST FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHAT YOU SAID ON THAT BUS 11 YEARS AGO THAT DID YOU NOT ACTUALLY KISS WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT OR GROPE WOMEN WITHOUT CONCEMENT. >> I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN. NO ONE HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO. >> YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEVER DID THAT? >> FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS. THEY ARE SAID. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT. BUT I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR WOMEN. >> HAVE YOU EVER DONE -- I HAVE RESPECT FOR ME. I WILL TELL YOU, NO, I HAVE NOT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU MILLIONS MORE FACT CHECKING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT IS -- JUST AWFULLY GOOD THAT SOMEONE WITH THE TEMPERAMENT OF DONALD TRUMP MUSLIMS COME IN AND REPORT WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING GOING ON. SEE HATRED, REPORT IT. OVER OBAMA. PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY LIKE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE, WHERE THEY ARE FROM, WHAT THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT OUR WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO. BUT I'LL TELL WHAT YOU HE'S GOING TO DO. HIS PLAN WILL GIVE THE WEALTHY CORPORATIONS, THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS THEY HAVE EVER HAD. MORE THAN THE BUSH TAX CUTS BY AT LEAST A FACTOR OF TWO. DONALD ALWAYS TAKES CARE OF INDEPENDENTS HAVE SAID THE SAME THING. WHAT WE ALL SAW AND HEARD ON FRIDAY WAS DONALD TALKING ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT WOMEN. WHAT HE DOES TO WOMEN. AND HE HAS SAID THAT THE VIDEO DOESN'T REPRESENT WHO HE IS. OFFICE AND ARE NOW MISSING. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I DIDN'T THINK I'D SAY THIS BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT. I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK ADVANTAGE OF EVERY SINGLE BREAK IN THE TAX CODE. YES, WHEN I WAS A SENATOR I DID VOTE TO CLOSE CORPORATE LOOPHOLES. VOTED TO CLOSE ONE OF THE LOOPHOLES HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF I HATE TO SAY IT. IS BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION, BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MUCH DECEPTION, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS. IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG TERM WORKERS AT THE FBI ARE FURIOUS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHERE E-MAILS AND YOU ACTION. >> IN THE PAST -- AND AGAIN, BERNIE SANDERS, IT'S REALLY BAD JUDGMENT. SHE HAS MADE BAD JUDGMENT NOT ONLY ON TAXES, SHE'S MADE BAD JUDGMENTS ON LIBYA. ON SYRIA, ON IRAQ. I MEAN HER AND OBAMA WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, THE WAY THEY GOT OUTED OF IRAQ, VACUUM THEY LEFT, THAT'S WHY ISIS FORMED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY STARTED FROM THAT LITTLE HAPPENED. IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, FAR WORSE, MINOR WORDS AND HIS WAS ACTION. I AM REMINDED OF WHAT MY FRIEND, MICHELLE OBAMA ADVISED US ALL. WHEN THEY GO LOW, YOU GO HIGH. [ Applause ] AND, LOOK, IF THIS WERE JUST ABOUT ONE VIDEO, MAYBE WHAT HE'S SAYING TONIGHT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT EVERYONE CAN DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS AT THIS POINT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE MAN IN THE AND I WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT IT IS HARD SOMETIMES TO GET THE CONGRESS TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT AND, YES, PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE SOME PEOPLE HE USED SOME ARGUMENTS, CONVINCING OTHER THAT JUST CAME OUT. AND SHE LIED. NOW SHE'S BLAMING THE LIE ON THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN THE ISIS LEADERS ARE THERE. WE HAVE ANNOUNCEMENTS COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON AND IRAQ, WE WILL BE ATTACKING MOSUL IN THREE WEEKS OR FOUR WEEKS. ALL OF THESE BAD LEADERS FROM ISIS ARE LEAVING MOSUL. WHY CAN'T THEY DO IT QUIETLY, WHY CAN'T THEY DO THE ATTACK, MAKE EIGHT SNEAK ATTACK AFTER THE ATTACK IS MADE, INFORM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT WE'VE KNOCKED OUT THE LEADERS, WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. TO BACK UP DIPLOMACY? >> I WOULD NOT USE AMERICAN GROUND FORCES IN SYRIA. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE. I DON'T THINK AMERICAN TROOPS SHOULD BE HOLDING TERRITORY, WHICH IS WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO AS AN OCCUPYING FORCE, I DON'T THINK THAT IS A SMART STRATEGY. OF WASHINGTON AND IRAQ, WE WILL BE ATTACKING MOSUL IN THREE WEEKS OR FOUR WEEKS. ALL OF THESE BAD LEADERS FROM ISIS ARE LEAVING MOSUL. WHY CAN'T THEY DO IT QUIETLY, WHY CAN'T THEY DO THE ATTACK, MAKE EIGHT SNEAK ATTACK AFTER THE ATTACK IS MADE, INFORM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT WE'VE KNOCKED OUT THE LEADERS, WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. PEOPLE LEAVE. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO SHAY WE'RE TO BACK UP DIPLOMACY? >> I WOULD NOT USE AMERICAN GROUND FORCES IN SYRIA. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY SERIOUS MISTAKE. I DON'T THINK AMERICAN TROOPS SHOULD BE HOLDING TERRITORY, WHICH IS WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO AS AN OCCUPYING FORCE, I DON'T THINK THAT IS A SMART STRATEGY. I DO THINK THE USE OF SPECIAL FORCES WHICH WE'RE USING, THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD. I WILL DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. I WILL DEFEND ROE V. WADE AND DEFEND WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO MAKE THEIR OWN HEALTHCARE DECISIONS. WE HAVE COME TOO FAR TO HAVE THAT TURNED BACK NOW. INDEED HE SAID WOMEN SHOULD BE PUNISHED, THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME FORM OF PUNISHMENT FOR THAT HAVE TO GO OUT. WE'RE GOING TO GET THEM OUT WE'RE GOING TO SECURITY BORDER AND ONCE THE BORDER IS SECURED AT A LATER DATE MAKE CAN'T EXPLOIT THEM AND UNDERCUT AMERICAN WAGES DONALD KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THIS HE USED UDOCUMENTED LABOR TO BUILD THE TRUMP TOWER. HE UNDERPAID UNDOCUMENTED THAT SOMEBODY RUNS ACROSS THE BORDER, BECOMES A CITIZEN UNDER HER PLAN YOU HAVE OPEN BORDERS, YOU WOULD HAVE A DISASTER ON TRADE, YOU WILL HAVE A DISASTER WITH YOUR OPEN BOARDERS. I HIT IT'S -- SHE HAS NO IDEA WHETHER IT'S RUSHA CHINA -- >> I'M NOT QUOTING MYSELF I AM -- >> YOU HAVE NO IDEA. >> -- DO YOU DOUBT 17 INTELLIGENCE -- >> HAVE NO IDEA. >> WELL, YOU HAVE -- VLADIMIR PUTIN THE MILITARY AND MILITARY INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE SWORN TO PROTECT US. I FIND THAT -- RAISING NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THIS IS A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN VERY CAVALIER, EVEN CASUAL ABOUT THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE'S ADVOCATED MORE COUNTRIES GETTING THEM JAPAN KOREA, EVEN LOOK, SHE'S BEEN PROVEN TO BE A LIAR ON SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER LIE. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> BY BUYING AMERICAN PRODUCTS. >> I ASKED THE SIMPLE QUESTION. SHE'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS, WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU DO IT OVER THE LAST 15, 20 YEARS. YOU WERE VERY MUCH INVOLVED -- EXCUSE ME, MY TURN. YOU WERE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN EVERY ASPECT OF THIS COUNTRY VERY MUCH. YOU DO HAVE EXPERIENCE. I SAY ONE THING YOU HAVE OVER ME IS EXPERIENCE, BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE WHAT YOU'VE DONE HAS TURNED OUT BADLY. FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN POSITION HELP, IF YOU SAY THAT I USE STEEL OR I USE SOMETHING JUST LIKE WHEN YOU RAN THE STATE DEPARTMENT, $6 BILLION WAS MISSING. HOW DO YOU MISS $6 BILLION? U RAN THE STATE DEPARTMENT. ABSOLUTELY, SIR, THAT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT THE RESULT OF THIS ELECTION. >> I WILL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME. I'M NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING NOW. I'LL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME. WHAT I'VE SEEN, WHAT I'VE SEEN IS SO BAD. FIRST OF ALL THE MEDIA IS SO DISHONEST AND SO CORRUPT AND PIE ON SO AMAZING ARE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" WROTE AN ARTICLE, BUT WITH E-MAILS AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS. >> BUT SIR THERE IS TRADITION IN THIS COUNTRY IN FACT ONE OF THE PRIDES OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER AND THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD FOUGHT A CAMPAIGN IS THAT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER, NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THE LOSER OR THE WINNER. BUILT THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER AND THAT THE COUNTRY THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER, NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THE LOSER OR THE WINNER. BUILT THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER AND THAT THE COUNTRY COMES TOGETHER IN PART FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY. ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE NOT PREPARED NOW TO -- >> WHAT I'M SAYING THAT I WILL TELL YOU AT THE TIME. I'LL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE. >> WELL, CHRIS, LET ME RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S HORRIFYING. EVERY TIME DONALD THINKS THINGS ARE NOT GOING IN HIS DIRECTION HE CLAIMS WHATEVER IT IS IS RIGGED AGAINST HIM. THE FBI CONDUCTED A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION INTO MY E-MAILS, THEY CONCLUDED THERE WAS NO CASE. HE SAID THE FBI WAS RIGGED. HE LOST THE IOWA CAUCUS, THE WISCONSIN PRIMARY, HE SAID THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY WAS RIGGED AGAINST HIM. THEN TRUMP UNIVERSITY GETS SUED FOR FRAUD AND RACKETEERING, HE CLAIMS THE COURT SYSTEM AND THE FEDERAL JUDGE IS RIGGED AGAINST HIM. THERE WAS EVEN A TIME WHEN HE DIDN'T GET AN EMMY FOR HIS TV PROGRAM THREE YEARS IN A ROW HE STARTED TWEETING THAT THE EMMYS WERE RIGGED -- >> SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT. >> THIS IS A MINDSET. THIS IS HOW DONALD THINKS. AND IT'S FUNNY, BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY TROUBLING. THAT IS NOT THE WAY OUR DEMOCRACY WORKS. WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR 240 YEARS. WE'VE HAD FAIRY PLEX, EVE ELECTED THE OUTCOMES WHEN WE MAY NOT HAVE LIKED THEM. AND THAT IS WHAT MUST BE EXPECTED OF ANYONE STANDING ON A DEBATE STAGE DURING A GENERAL ELECTION. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU'RE WHINING -- >> HOLD ON FOLKS. >> IT JUST SHOWS YOU'RE NOT UP TO DOING THE JOB. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE IS SAYING WHAT THAT MEANS. COMMITMENT TO RAISE TAXES ON THE WEALTHY. MY SOCIAL SECURITY PAYROLL CONTRIBUTION WILL GO UP AS WILL DONALD'S ASSUMING HE CAN'T TODAY, YOUR DAUGHTER WE VANG COULD SAID THE SAME THING. I WOULDN'T ASK YOU HERE ON THIS STAGE TONIGHT, DO YOU MAKE THE SAME COMMITMENT THAT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY, SIR, THAT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT THE RESULT OF THIS ELECTION. >> I WILL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME. I'M NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING NOW. I'LL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME. WHAT I'VE SEEN, WHAT I'VE SEEN IS SO BAD. FIRST OF ALL THE MEDIA IS SO DISHONEST AND SO CORRUPT AND PIE ON SO AMAZING ARE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" WROTE AN ARTICLE, BUT THEY DON'T CARE. IT'S SO DISHONEST, THEY HAVE POISONED THE MINDS OF THE VOTERS. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEM, I THINK THE VOTERS ARE SEEING THROUGH IT. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO SEE THROUGH IT. WE'LL FIND OUT. >> BUT SIR -- IF YOU LOOK, EXCUSE ME, CHRIS. IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR VOTER ROLLS YOU WILL SEE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE, MILLIONS -- THIS ISN'T COMING FROM ME THIS IS COMING FROM A REPORT, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE THAT SHOULDN'T BE REGISTERED TO VOTE. LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE OTHER THING. I TALK ABOUT THE CORRUPT MEDIA, THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, TELL YOU ONE OTHER THING. SHE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO RUN. IT'S CROOKED. SHE'S GUILTY OF VERY SERIOUS CRIME. SHE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO RUN. AND JUST IN THAT RESPECT I SAY IT'S RIGGED. BECAUSE SHE SHOULD NEVER -- CHRIS, SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY BASED ON WHAT SHE DID WITH E-MAILS AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS. >> BUT SIR THERE IS TRADITION IN THIS COUNTRY IN FACT ONE OF THE PRIDES OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER AND THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD FOUGHT A CAMPAIGN IS THAT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER, NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THE LOSER OR THE WINNER. BUILT THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO STAGE TONIGHT, DO YOU MAKE THE SAME COMMITMENT THAT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY, SIR, THAT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT THE RESULT OF THIS ELECTION. >> I WILL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME. I'M NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING NOW. I'LL LOOK AT IT AT THE TIME. WHAT I'VE SEEN, WHAT I'VE SEEN IS SO BAD. FIRST OF ALL THE MEDIA IS SO DISHONEST AND SO CORRUPT AND PIE ON SO AMAZING ARE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" WROTE AN ARTICLE, BUT ACCOUNT. >> MR. TRUMP, YOUR REACTION, PARTICULARLY ON THIS ISSUE OF LATE-TERM PER SHALL BIRTH -- >> I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE IF YOU GO WITH WHAT HILLARY IS SAYING IN THE 9th MONTH YOU CAN TAKE THE BABY AND RIP THE BABY OUT OF THE WOMB OF THE MOTHER JUST PRIOR TO THE BIRTH OF THE BABY. NOW, YOU CAN SAY THAT THAT'S OKAY AND HILLARY CAN SAY THAT THAT'S OKAY. BUT IT'S NOT OKAY WITH ME. BECAUSE BASED ON WHAT SHE IS SAYING BASED ON WHERE SHE'S THEY EXPANDED WE DIDN'T. PLAYING CHICKEN. LOOK PUTIN FROM EVERYTHING I SEE HAVE 240 RESPECT FOR THIS PERSON. >> THAT'S BECAUSE HE'D RATHER DEPORTED WE SHOULD DEPORT THEM. WHEN IT COMES TO THE WALL THAT DONALD TALKS ABOUT BUILDING, HE PERSON, ANYBODY WHO SHOULD BE DEPORTED WE SHOULD DEPORT THEM. WHEN IT COMES TO THE WALL THAT DEALS OF ANY KIND SIGNED BY ANYBODY, IT'S A DISASTER. HILLARY CLINTON WANTED THE WALL. HILLARY CLINTON FOUGHT FOR THE WALL. IN 2006 OR THEREABOUTS. NOW, SHE NEVER GETS ANYTHING PLAYING CHICKEN. LOOK PUTIN FROM EVERYTHING I SEE HAVE 240 RESPECT FOR THIS PERSON. >> THAT'S BECAUSE HE'D RATHER ENCOURAGE ESPYIANAGE AGAINST OUR PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SPOUT THE PUTIN LINE, SIGN UP FOR HIS WISH LIST, RAKE UP NATO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO. BEHIND THE ATTACKS. EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHETHER THEY ARE DO YOU CONDEMN ANY INTERFERENCE BY RUSSIA IN THE AMERICAN ELECTION? >> BY RUSSIA OR ANYBODY ELSE. >> YOU CONDEMN THEY'RE INTERFERENCE. >> OF COURSE I CONDEMN. I DON'T KNOW PUTIN. >> I'M ASKING YOU -- THIS IS NOT MY BEST FRIEND. IF THE UNITED STATES GOT ALONG I BELIEVE IT WAS HER CAMPAIGN THAT DID IT. JUST LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT CAME OUT TODAY ON THE CLIPS WHERE I WAS WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY RALLY IN CHICAGO. OTHER RALLIES WHERE WE HAD SUCH VIOLENCE. SHE'S THE ONE AND OBAMA THAT CAUSED THE RALLIES. THEY HIRED PEOPLE, THEY PAID RALLIES WHERE HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE DONE THOSE THINGS TO THOSE WOMEN BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE TAKE THEIR MONEY. SO, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU RIGHT NOW, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE BACK THE MONEY THAT YOU'VE TAKEN FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES THAT TREAT CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE SO HORRIBLY. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE BACK THE MONEY? I THINK WAIT BE GREAT GESTURE. BECAUSE SHE TAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE PEOPLE OF HAITI. I WAS IN LITTLE HAITI THE OTHER DAY IN FLORIDA. I WANT TO TELL YOU THEY HATE THE CLINTONS. BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN HAITI WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS A DISGRACE. YOU KNOW IT. THEY KNOW IT. AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. >> SECRETARY CLINTON. >> VERY QUICKLY, WE AT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SPEND 90% -- DONATED ON BEHALF OF PROGRAMS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT. THE HIGHEST RATING FROM THE WATCH DOGS THAT FOLLOW FOUNDATION. I'D BE HAPPY TO COMPARE WHAT WE DO WITH THE TRUMP FOUNDATION, WHICH TOOK MONEY FROM OTHER PRESIDENCY BASED ON WHAT SHE DID WITH E-MAILS AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS. >> BUT SIR THERE IS TRADITION IN THIS COUNTRY IN FACT ONE OF THE PRIDES OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER AND THAT NO MATTER HOW COMES TOGETHER IN PART FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY. ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE NOT >> APPROVES IT EVERY TIME. >> YOU ARE THE ONE THAT IS UNFIT. WIKILEAKS CAME OUT, JOHN PODESTA SAID SOME HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT YOU. AND, BOY WAS HE RIGHT. NOW, JOHN PODESTA SAID YOU HAVE TERRIBLE INSTINCTS. BERNIE SANDERS SAID YOU HAVE BAD JUDGMENT, I AGREE WITH BOTH. >> YOU SHOULD ASK BERNIE SANDERS ARE SPENDING A FORTUNE DOING IT. THEY HAVE THE BARGAIN OF THE CENTURY, ALL I SAID IS WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE THESE AGREEMENTS BECAUSE POUR COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD TO DEFEND SAUDI ARABIA, JAPAN, GERMANY, SOUGHT KOREA MANY OTHER PLACES WE CANNOT CONTINUE -- SHE TOOK THAT AS SAYING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. SAUDI ARABIA GIVING $25 MILLION. QATAR, ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES YOU TALK ABOUT WOMEN AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS. SO THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT PUSH GAYF OFF BUILDINGS. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT KILL WOMEN AND TREAT WOMEN HORRIBLY YET YOU TAKE THEIR MONEY. SO, I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU RIGHT NOW, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE BACK THE MONEY THAT YOU'VE TAKEN FROM INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE CONFIRMED TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. I ACTUALLY THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION OF THIS EVENING, CHRIS, IS FINALLY WILL DONALD TRUMP ADMIT AND CONDEMN THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE DOING BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THESE WOMEN. I DIDN'T SEE THESE WOMEN. THESE WOMEN THE ONE ON THE PLANE, I THINK THEY WANT EITHER FAME OR HER CAMPAIGN DID IT. I THINK IT'S HER CAMPAIGN. BECAUSE WHAT I SAW WHAT THEY DID, WHICH IS A CRIMINAL ACT, BY THE WAY, WHERE THEY ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO GO OUT START FIST FIGHTS AND START VIOLENCE. THINGS. >> BUT SIR THERE IS TRADITION IN THIS COUNTRY IN FACT ONE OF THE PRIDES OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER AND THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD FOUGHT A CAMPAIGN IS THAT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER, NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THE LOSER OR THE WINNER. BUILT THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER AND THAT THE COUNTRY COMES TOGETHER IN PART FOR THE PLAYING CHICKEN. LOOK PUTIN FROM EVERYTHING I SEE HAVE 240 RESPECT FOR THIS PERSON. >> THAT'S BECAUSE HE'D RATHER HAVE A PUPPET AS PRESIDENT. >> NO PUPPET. >> IT'S PRETTY CLEAR -- YOU'RE THE PUPPET. >> IT'S CLEAR YOU WON'T ADMIT -- >>  YOU'RE THE PUPPET. >> RUSSIANS HAVE ENGAGED IN CYBERATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BUT YOU ENCOURAGE ESPYIANAGE AGAINST OUR PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO IT'S RIGGED. BECAUSE SHE SHOULD NEVER -- CHRIS, SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY BASED ON WHAT SHE DID WITH E-MAILS AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS. >> BUT SIR THERE IS TRADITION IN THIS COUNTRY IN FACT ONE OF THE PRIDES OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER AND THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD FOUGHT A CAMPAIGN IS THAT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER, NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THE LOSER OR THE WINNER. BUILT THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER AND THAT THE COUNTRY PLAYING CHICKEN. LOOK PUTIN FROM EVERYTHING I SEE HAVE 240 RESPECT FOR THIS PERSON. >> THAT'S BECAUSE HE'D RATHER HAVE A PUPPET AS PRESIDENT. >> NO PUPPET. AFFORD TO DEFEND SAUDI ARABIA, JAPAN, GERMANY, SOUGHT KOREA MANY OTHER PLACES WE CANNOT CONTINUE -- SHE TOOK THAT AS SAYING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. LOOK, SHE'S BEEN PROVEN TO BE A LIAR ON SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. IT'S RIGGED. BECAUSE SHE SHOULD NEVER -- CHRIS, SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY BASED ON WHAT SHE DID WITH E-MAILS AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS. >> BUT SIR THERE IS TRADITION IN THIS COUNTRY IN FACT ONE OF THE PRIDES OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER AND THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD FOUGHT A CAMPAIGN IS THAT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER, NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THE LOSER OR THE WINNER. BUILT THAT THE LOSER CONCEDES TO THE WINNER AND THAT THE COUNTRY COMES TOGETHER IN PART FOR THE GOING TO GET MOSUL, REALLY? WE'LL SAY MOSUL EVENTUALLY. BY THE WAY, IF YOU LOOK WHAT'S PROGRAMS. >> WELL, CHRIS, I AM ON RECORD AS SAYING THAT WE NEED TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND, THAT'S PART OF MY COMMITMENT TO RAISE TAXES ON THE WEALTHY. MY SOCIAL SECURITY PAYROLL CONTRIBUTION WILL GO UP AS WILL WHY? BECAUSE HIS WHOLE PLAN TO CUT TAXES, GIVE BIGGEST TAX BREAKS EVER TO THE WEALTHY AND TO CORPORATIONS. ADDING $20 TRILLION TO OUR DEBT AND PAUSING THE KIND OF DISLOCATION THAT WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE, BECAUSE IT TRULY WILL BE TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS ON STEROIDS. SO THE PLAN I HAVE I THINK WILL ACTUALLY PRODUCE GREATER MEXICO AND OTHER PLACES. WE'RE BRINGING OUR JOBS BACK. I'M GOING TO RENEGOTIATE NAFTA, IF I CAN'T MAKE A GREAT DEAL WE'RE GOING TO TERMINATE NAFTA CREATE NEW DEALS. WE'LL HAVE TRADE. WE'RE GOING TO TERMINATE IT, THEM. NOW, WHAT WAS HIS RESPONSE. WELL, HE HELD A NUMBER OF BIG RALLIES WHERE HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE DONE >> SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT. >> THIS IS A MINDSET. THIS IS HOW DONALD THINKS. AND IT'S FUNNY, BUT IT'S ALSO\n"

    "### Differences in Data Sets\n",
    "The data sets are in various formats, each encoded differently. This means, we have to use of different Python modules for processing, such as xml, json, and csv. XML files, for instance, need iterating through various XML tags to extract relevant information.\n",
    "The structure of nested JSON adds complexity, requiring the implementation of recursive methods to get the data hierarchy and retrieve all comments within a thread.\n",
    "Handling .csv files entails considerations of both rows and columns, making the pandas module indispensable for efficient data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements\n",
    "Each data format have different challenges when generating word clouds. For instance, while parsing the xml files, we have to take care to extract meaningful text content from within the XML tags, excluding any markup or structural elements that may distort the word cloud.\n",
    "Similarly, dealing with nested JSON structures demands a comprehensive approach to ensure all relevant comments are captured, especially in multi-threaded discussions where comments may be deeply nested within parent threads. This means we need recursive functions to account for any depth in nesting. In contrast, processing .csv files involves organizing the data into a format suitable for word cloud generation, which means we need to filter out irrelevant syntax and symbols and focus solely on textual content. The Pandas Module is useful to structure the data into a table to mirror its form in the csv and then we can work on it more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "One notable improvement in word cloud generation across all data formats is the need to remove syntax symbols and non-textual elements from the word cloud.\n",
    "Therefore the word cloud represents the content of the text, without distortion from symbols like \">\". Additionally, observing Zipf's law in action within the word cloud highlights the importance of handling stop words effectively. By filtering out common stop words like \"the\" \"and\" \"of\" and prioritizing content-bearing terms based on their frequency, we can enhance the information we get from the word clouds and gain a better insight of the text."
